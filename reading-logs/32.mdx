This week I read about Reddit‚Äôs bullshit and CEOs screwing over employees.

    I call bullshit.

    I‚Äôve been working remotely for 3 years now and I feel like I collaborate with my team well and we produce great work. I also feel like my productivity has only increased.

    There are some people who like working in the office, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Not everyone feels that way and many are just as productive working from home, some probably more so from the lack of constant interruptions from the ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù.

    What this feels like is companies trying to justify their middle managers and office leases. Meanwhile their workers, who they likely need most, suffer.
