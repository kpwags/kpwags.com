This week I look at a new game that helps illuminate what the content moderators of sites like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit have to deal with. I‚Äôve also read about writing better CSS, Bookshop.org‚Äôs rise, return to office shenanigans and more.

    Everyone tends to think that they can do content moderation better than Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and all the other social media sites. The truth of the matter is that it‚Äôs not easy. Sure some posts should be pretty obvious they need to be removed, but there‚Äôs also a lot more nuance behind it.

    > A friend of mine in the trust & safety world once suggested that these conversations would be a lot more useful if everyone had to spend a few days moderating an actual community, and could learn how content moderation is not about ‚Äúsuppressing viewpoints,‚Äù but almost always about understanding really complex scenarios in which you have to make decisions in a very limited period of time, with limited information, and where there may not be any ‚Äúright‚Äù answer.

    Nails it right on the head. The moderators are having to deal with countless reports in a very short timeframe and are often dealing with content that can be absolutely awful and soul sucking.

    This little game helps show some of the pressures and things the moderators have to deal with. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a go.
