Two weeks worth of articles this week as I was in New York City last weekend. This log has a bunch of news out of the Microsoft-Activision acquisition, Reddit following the path of Twitter, and more.

   I completely agree with Marco here.

    > The tech you use doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is that you satisfy the needs of your users. Your users don‚Äôt care what tech you use, but they do care if your website or application works as intended and if they can achieve the task or find the information they came for.

    Use the tech stack that works for you. There‚Äôs no one tech stack to rule them all. Use what makes sense for you. Use what allows you to create the features and the desired user experience for your customers in a fast and efficient manner.
