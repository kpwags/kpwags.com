A little light this week, but some changes to the Reddit API look to be coming, AI might not be the job killer many seem to think it is and more.

    I’m not a fan of the new Reddit website and still use `old.reddit.com` as my way to view Reddit. Their mobile website and app are trash so Apollo on my iPad as been my Reddit gateway more often than not. If Reddit kills it off...my time on Reddit will probably crater (which to be honest, is probably not a bad thing).

    It is sad that Reddit, following in Twitter’s footsteps looks to be taking the route of killing off 3rd party apps that help make Reddit what it is.
