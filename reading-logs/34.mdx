Got a lot this week. The NHL and Paramout+ make very poor decisions, some CSS & dev tool tips, Meta's possibly joining ActivityPub and more.

    This is absolute garbage. I [wrote more about it](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/06/24/gary-bettman-and-the-nhl-are-cowards), but needless to say, the NHL are trash for making this decision. Inclusion is incredibly important and all this does is tell an already marginalized community that they aren‚Äôt welcome. Hockey is for everyone. Everyone regardless of who they are should be able to lace up their skates and play.

    There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about owning your purchases. This is the perfect example why.

    For some shows it might not matter. There have been plenty of shows I‚Äôve been luke warm on and maybe don‚Äôt care if it disappears. But there are plenty of go-to shows that would be nice to always have access to. This is why I‚Äôve been buying the DVD/Bluray sets of various shows over the last few years. It‚Äôs also why I‚Äôve been buying more music. It‚Äôs nice to know that movies, shows, & music I like can‚Äôt be pulled out from under me.

    Streaming might have it‚Äôs place, but it also has its downsides.
