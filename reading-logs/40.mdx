Hey there, this week I read about the question of if a "Regular Joe" could get a hit in the major leagues, more .NET 8 news, NYT and ChatGPT, and more.

    > Hayes wondered the same. “I was recently at a batting cage and spent about half an hour, got the speed up to 70 mph, and after enough of them I was more or less getting around, though mostly fouling pitches off, with occasional solid contact,” he wrote in an email. “BUT: no breaking balls and no pitches out of the zone. I just think any major leaguer would be able to just terrify me with a first pitch fastball and then get me to chase garbage out of the zone and that would happen for literally an entire season.”

    I played baseball growing up. I don’t think I’d have much success getting a hit. I think I’d be able to eventually make contact, but not much of any substance. Pitchers today are just too good.
