The truth of the matter is that it‚Äôs not easy. Sure some posts should be pretty obvious they need to be removed, but there‚Äôs also a lot more nuance behind it.</p><blockquote>\n<p>A friend of mine in the trust &amp; safety world once suggested that these conversations would be a lot more useful if everyone had to spend a few days moderating an actual community, and could learn how content moderation is not about ‚Äúsuppressing viewpoints,‚Äù but almost always about understanding really complex scenarios in which you have to make decisions in a very limited period of time, with limited information, and where there may not be any ‚Äúright‚Äù answer.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Nails it right on the head. The moderators are having to deal with countless reports in a very short timeframe and are often dealing with content that can be absolutely awful and soul sucking.</p><p>This little game helps show some of the pressures and things the moderators have to deal with. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a go.</p></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3>üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Software Development &amp; Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/blogs/10-awesome-csharp-refactoring-tips\">10 Awesome C# Refactoring Tips</a> - <em>Assis Zang</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webscope.io/blog/server-components-vs-ssr\">Server Components vs. SSR in Next.js</a> - <em>Jan Kori≈•√°k</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/reading-order/\">Solving the CSS layout and source order disconnect</a> - <em>Rachel Andrew</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/custom-properties-beyond-the-root\">CSS Custom Properties Beyond the :root</a> - <em>Matthias Ott</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackify.com/opentelemetry-dotnet/\">A Guide to OpenTelemetry for .NET Engineers</a> - <em>Stackify</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/04/write-better-css-borrow-ideas-javascript-functions/\">Write Better CSS By Borrowing Ideas From JavaScript Functions</a> - <em>Yaphi Berhanu</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/10/02/scrum-versus-kanban.html\">You don&#x27;t need Scrum.

It would help with mocking for unit tests and it would also help ensure that I build out all the CRUD functionality.</p>\n<p>So let‚Äôs use .NET‚Äôs generic types to build out an interface that I can use.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codegroup not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-editor-frame\" style=\"background:#22272e\"><div class=\"ch-frame-title-bar\" style=\"color:#768390;background:#1c2128\"><div class=\"ch-frame-buttons\"><div class=\"ch-frame-button ch-frame-button-left\"></div><div class=\"ch-frame-button-space\"></div><div class=\"ch-frame-button ch-frame-button-middle\"></div><div class=\"ch-frame-button-space\"></div><div class=\"ch-frame-button ch-frame-button-right\"></div></div><div title=\"IRepository.cs\" data-ch-tab=\"north\" class=\"ch-editor-tab ch-editor-tab-active\" style=\"background:#22272e;color:#adbac7;border-right-color:#444c56;border-bottom-color:#22272e\"><div><span style=\"opacity:0.5\"></span>IRepository.cs</div></div><div style=\"flex:1;min-width:0.8em\"></div></div><div data-ch-panel=\"north\" style=\"flex-grow:1;overflow:hidden\"><div class=\"ch-code-wrapper\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto;height:100%\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>public interface IRepository&lt;T&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>{</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    T GetById(int id);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    IQueryable&lt;T&gt; GetAll();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    Task&lt;int&gt; Add(T entity);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    Task Update(T entity);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    Task Delete(int id);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div></div></div>\n<p>This defines a generic repository for type <code>T</code> where <code>T</code> can be any class.

I took some of the designing I was doing with Astro and applied it to my current platform. The work was fun and in the end my site is now running the latest version of Next.js (for now) and looks a tad bit better. The downside is that I had to remove my photography section and photo blog temporarily while I find a CDN to store the images.</p>\n<h2>A Nice Long Weekend</h2>\n<p>At the end of the month, my wife and I went to Cape May, New Jersey to celebrate her birthday. The weather was gorgeous and we were able to check out the local wineries and just sit out on our hotel‚Äôs veranda with a drink and read. It wasn‚Äôt a full week, but the long weekend was the perfect way to unwind.</p>\n<h2>Hey, We‚Äôre League Champions!</h2>\n<p>The latest I-League season at my rink ended this month and my team was able to win the upper bracket championship.

You might have noticed the changes to the look and the feel.</p>\n<p>Playing around with Astro I realized that I wanted to give my site a bit of a refresh. And given that I‚Äôve put Astro on hold for the time being, I figured I‚Äôd take a break and apply some of the refreshes I was developing with Astro to my Next.js implementation.</p>\n<p>Some of the changes that I made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the font options. I know it kind of feels like removing functionality, but I thought more about it and it will be easier for me to handle typography. I chose the monospaced font because I like the way it looks and feels.</li>\n<li>Better handled my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/bookshelf\">bookshelf</a>, <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/tv\">TV</a>, <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/movies\">movies</a>, &amp; <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/video-games\">video game</a> pages. I didn‚Äôt like the way I was handling the wider widths so I laid out the HTML elements better to allow for a wider width for the pages.</li>\n<li>Changed the look and feel of blog headers both on the entry page and on the listing pages.</li>\n<li>Improved the header to allow for search and theme picking from mobile.</li>\n<li>Added a proper 404 page.</li>\n<li>Cleaned up all the front matter in my blog posts since they were all over the place depending on when I wrote the post.</li>\n<li>Added <a href=\"https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/\">Sandpack</a> support for future posts where I want to include a code sandbox.</li>\n<li>Switched from Prism to <a href=\"https://codehike.org/\">Code Hike</a> for my code blocks.</li>\n<li>Upgraded Next.js to v13.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The one downside that I came across was upgrading to Next.js 13 caused some issues with deploying my site to Netlify. I‚Äôve had to remove my photography pages until I can move the images into a CDN. I had been including them in the project (probably foolishly) and with the upgrade to Next.js and Netlify‚Äôs Next.js plugin, it made my deploy way too large. I‚Äôll probably look into S3 or something similar so I can re-add the photographs back. So a bummer, but hopefully only temporary.</p>\n<p>I might be making some tweaks here and there, but if you notice anything weird, please let me know.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

As an adult it‚Äôs no different.</p>\n<p>One of the apps on my iPhone is <a href=\"https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard\">Libby</a> which allows me to borrow eBooks from my local library. I discovered it during the pandemic and it gives me access to books on my Kindle with the press of a button.</p>\n<p>Like physical books, libraries only have so many digital copies available to lend as well. The nice part is that if they have the book you want to read but it‚Äôs checked out, you can easily add yourself to the waiting list to get it as soon as it becomes available. Another nice (or maybe not so nice thing from some points of view) is that because it‚Äôs digital, once the two weeks the reader has are up, it gets ‚Äúreturned‚Äù to the library for the next person. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the person before you losing it or returning it a month late.</p>\n<p>They haven‚Äôt had every book on my reading list, but it‚Äôs a nice way to take advantage of what my local library offers.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd highly recommend seeing what your local libraries offer digitally, and any other of their services.

Step one was to get the database setup.</p>\n<p>This is the second post in a multi-part series. If you haven&#x27;t read part one, you can <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/03/19/digging-into-blazor-first-impressions\">read about my first impressions</a>.</p>\n<p>I had already decided to use Entity Framework to interact with my SQL server. I have used Entity Framework plenty in the past so I was familiar with the basics. If you haven&#x27;t used Entity Framework, I would highly recommend reading about it and going through some tutorials. Microsoft provides some <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/\">great documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did was look into how to use <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/blazor-server-ef-core?view=aspnetcore-7.0\">Entity Framework with Blazor</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Blazor Server apps, scoped service registrations can be problematic because the instance is shared across components within the user&#x27;s circuit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well that&#x27;s different.</p>\n<p>I quickly realized that things were a little different, but following their setup, I worked to make sure that each interaction would operate in its own context. Reading more I found out that Microsoft recommended I use a factory to help. I added the DB Factory to my <code>Program.cs</code> file. The nice part is that it&#x27;s very similar to how I configure it in my other projects.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>// Program.cs</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>builder.Services.AddDbContextFactory&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(opt =&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    opt.UseSqlServer(configuration.GetConnectionString(&quot;Main&quot;)));</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Setting up my models worked the same way as <a href=\"https://github.com/kpwags/digital-family-cookbook\">Digital Family Cookbook</a>.</p>\n<p>Let&#x27;s create my first database table and model.

It gave me the chance to get my camera out and enjoy my hobby. I still need to go through the photos, and I&#x27;m thinking it will be a good chance to give <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746\">Darkroom</a> a try.</p>\n<h2>Whiskey Dinner</h2>\n<p>Later in the month, Lauren and I went to Bloom Southern Kitchen again for another food and drink pairing. This time it was what they called a ‚ÄúSingle Malt Showcase‚Äù where we tasted some single malt whiskeys from India, Japan and more. It was another good time and we&#x27;re planning on going to another in May and then again in June.</p>\n<h2>Digging into Astro</h2>\n<p>You know the saying that developers can&#x27;t finish a side project? Yeah, that trend continues as I&#x27;ve been splitting my time between Blazor and re-writing my blog using Astro 2.0. I&#x27;m actually pretty impressed with how easy it is to implement. I miss bits and pieces of React &amp; Next.js, but man is Astro fast. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll end up switching platforms, but I&#x27;m liking the ease of developer experience.</p>\n<h2>Continuing Blazor</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been making good progress with my card organizer in Blazor. I&#x27;m amazed at how fast it is to build an app with Blazor. It&#x27;s taken a slight back seat with my blog rewrite in Astro, but I&#x27;m getting it into a good place.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Round-Up</h2>\n<p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Running:</strong> I ended up running 35 miles in March.

And while I don&#x27;t necessarily listen to every episode of every podcast I subscribe to, it does lead to my podcast queue to become rather unruly.</p>\n<p>Right now, my queue stands at 283 episodes totaling over 250 hours worth of content. The funny thing is that it was over 900 episodes before I got a new iPhone and ended up clearing out a lot of my queue due to a sync issue with PocketCasts. I probably could have recovered most of it, but given the large number and how old some of the episodes were, I took it as a chance to trim the queue.</p>\n<p>I don&#x27;t really know what a good solution is. I go through my ‚Äúnew‚Äù filter and archive the episodes I know I don&#x27;t have an interest in, queue the ones I do and see the queue count grow.</p>\n<p>I try to keep up with it, but I don&#x27;t always get the chance to listen on a regular basis. If I&#x27;m deep in thought trying to solve a difficult task at work, music ends up being a better option as I don&#x27;t have to keep track of the story or discussion. Nothing is more frustrating than missing several minutes worth of discussion because you&#x27;re focused on something else, then are trying to catch up with what you missed. This is a case where me listening at podcasts at 2x speed might not be the most helpful.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s a shame really because many of the podcasts I listen to are interesting and I WANT to listen to them all, but might just be resigned to having a queue that dates back 6+ months. The best ‚Äúprocess‚Äù I have going at the moment is to just archive the episode I&#x27;m listening to if it doesn&#x27;t grab my attention after 5-10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Are there any tools or apps that you can think of that might help keep my queue a little more organized? I currently use PocketCasts to listen to podcasts with a filter for all new podcasts. I generally add most episodes to the end of the queue so I listen to the oldest episodes first.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Playing around with it, my first thought was this felt kind of similar to my time years ago working with ASP.NET MVC sites. It was different, and it looked different in a good way, but the little bit of familiarity was definitely beneficial as it gave me a good jumping off point.</p>\n<p>After going through the tutorials, I realized I needed something to build. The best way I&#x27;ve found for myself to learn new languages and tools is to build something. Tutorials only go so far. The project I decided to build is an app to inventory my baseball and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Customizable_Card_Game\">Star Wars Customizable Card Game</a> cards. I recently found a bunch of cards from when I was a kid, so I figured it&#x27;d be a fun way to learn a new framework.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did was to figure out the technology I was going to use. To make things simple, I was just going to stick with Microsoft technologies for the core of the app. I was going to store the data with Entity Framework and use Microsoft Identity for user authentication. I&#x27;m not sure I really need user authentication for a little side project, but figured ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ll go into more details in later posts, but suffice it to say, it was both familiar and alien at the same time. The libraries used have been the same ones I&#x27;ve used in both Digital Family Cookbook and my fitness tracker which helped smooth out the differences in usage. But the ways I needed to use them posed some challenges and made my learning curve a tad bit steeper.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve also decided to use Tailwind to help with the styling for this project. This is one of the things I kind of miss from working with React, TypeScript &amp; Vite. The build system made it pretty easy to adjust to changes. I&#x27;m currently having some issues in bundling my CSS. Part of this is because I&#x27;m trying to trim down the Tailwind bundle size by limiting what Tailwind classes are included. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to make this easier, but I often find myself having to manually run a <code>yarn</code> command to build the latest CSS based on the classes included. This is probably a little more on me though as I probably need to familiarize myself with some of the internal tooling.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been making a lot of progress over the last few weeks. So much so that I&#x27;m actually a little surprised at how easy it is to build things. In my case it helps that I&#x27;m familiar with .NET, but I think that bodes well for Blazor. The easier it is to get a minimal viable product (MVP) out the door, the better.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m excited by how nice it is to work in Blazor and am hoping by sharing my experiences starting up, I can help others get off the ground.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It was certainly a bummer, but alas.</p>\n<h2>Fitness Goals Coming Along Nicely</h2>\n<p>With regards to my strength training, my switch to <em>nSuns</em> is going well. I&#x27;ve been getting back up to my previous highs and have broken my deadlifts PR by 5 lbs. hitting 1 rep at 390. Currently sitting at 965 lbs. towards the 1,000 lbs. club. Maybe March will be the lucky month. I might drop weights afterwards a tad to focus on getting higher reps, but I&#x27;ll decide that later.</p>\n<p>With running, the weather has been crazy warm and I&#x27;ve taken advantage of that to run some longer distances. I&#x27;d been focusing on running 3 miles per run, this month I was targeting 4+ miles. Managed that on all but one run, and even hit 5 and then 6 miles too. Getting some longer runs in earlier will hopefully help a bit when I go to start training for the marathon later in the year.</p>\n<h2>Traveling to Hershey</h2>\n<p>At the end of the month, Lauren and I drove out to Hershey, Pennsylvania to explore some of their distilleries and breweries, and to see a Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey game against the local Bears team.</p>\n<p>The hotel we stayed up was awesomely enough within walking distance of some great restaurants and distilleries.

I&#x27;m making good progress and hope to have an MVP out in the next month or so.</p>\n<h2>Work</h2>\n<p>Work has been going well so far this year. I&#x27;ve been working on getting several pages rewritten into React to make it a little easier for my team and the design team to work on them.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve also been immersing myself in the database project to help set it up for true integration tests. We&#x27;ve been using mock data which is less than ideal.

Luck has played a role in me getting to where I am now as well.</p>\n<p>I think about how lucky I am that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was born in a solidly middle class family</li>\n<li>I was born in a country that allowed me to explore a multitude of opportunities</li>\n<li>Both my parents were always there to help and support me</li>\n<li>My Dad was an engineer who was always able to help me with any math and science classes all the way through college.</li>\n<li>My Mom was a teacher who could help me with English and literature classes.</li>\n<li>I grew up never having to worry about food on my plate or a roof over my head.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is just a subset of it all. None of this I had any control over. It just was.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that those who didn&#x27;t have what I had growing up couldn&#x27;t achieve what I have, it just made my journey all that much easier. It also makes it all that much more impressive for those that have had more barriers to break through.</p>\n<p>It really makes me count my blessings and be ever more thankful for everything I have.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I&#x27;ve made a concerted effort to drink less alcohol and try to limit my snacking. So far it&#x27;s been working. I didn&#x27;t do <em>Dry January</em> but I did a better job of not overindulging on the weekends.</p>\n<p>With the nice weather, I&#x27;ve also been getting more runs in. I managed 48 miles in January, somehow running in the high 40s and low 50s some days.</p>\n<p>With regards to lifting, I switched back to running an <em>nSuns</em> based routine. I&#x27;m putting in more sets and reps and have been getting back to my personal bests. I&#x27;m 100 pounds away from my goal of joining the 1,000 pound club!</p>\n<h2>Picking Up Blazor</h2>\n<p>As a .NET developer, Blazor has been on my radar for a little while now. I decided to play around with it and learn by building a web app to go through and organize my baseball card collection (because why not?).

There will be a lot of duplicates here, so I use JavaScript‚Äôs <code>Set</code> object to create a unique list.</p>\n<h3>An Aside</h3>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const years = [...new Set(allYears)];</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>By passing in an array to the <code>Set</code> constructor, and spreading it into an array, it will remove duplicates and create a distinct list...quite useful.</p>\n<h3>Back to the Point</h3>\n<p>At this point I have an array of years with their associated number of posts</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t{ year: 2013, count: 11 },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t{ year: 2014, count: 14 },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t...</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t{ year: 2023, count: 6 }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>]</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>So at this point, my <code>stats.ts</code> library file looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>export const getStats = (): Stats =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const posts = getAllPosts();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        PostsPerYear: getPostsPerYear(posts),</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    };</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>I then can take that data and pass it into a component to create a nice graphic. More on that later.</p>\n<h2>Most Popular Tags</h2>\n<p>While working on the years, I realized that when I converted my site to run on [Next.js], I added tags to all of my posts. While there are many tags I‚Äôve used, I figured the ten most popular could be a good item to show.</p>\n<p>This one was going to prove to be a little more challenging. For reference, each blog post has an array of tags for it.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;Reading Log&#x27;, url: &#x27;reading-log&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;Twitter&#x27;, url: &#x27;twitter&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;C#&#x27;, url: &#x27;csharp&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;.NET&#x27;, url: &#x27;.net&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;CSS&#x27;, url: &#x27;css&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;Unit Testing&#x27;, url: &#x27;unit-testing&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;NASA&#x27;, url: &#x27;nasa&#x27; },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    { name: &#x27;JWST&#x27;, url: &#x27;jwst&#x27; }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>]</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This is an example from my [Reading Log - January 20 (#15)] post. Each tag has 2 properties. The display name, and the URL slug that corresponds to it. I‚Äôve toyed with trying to auto-generate it, but this has worked for me thus far.</p>\n<p>To find the tags most commonly used, I wanted to create an array of tags with their associated post count.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t{ name: &quot;Reading Log&quot;, url: &quot;reading-log&quot;, count: 42 },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t{ name: &quot;Life&quot;, url: &quot;life&quot;, count: 40 },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t...</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t{ name: &quot;Monthly Check-In&quot;, url: &quot;monthly-check-in&quot;, count: 16 }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>]</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>By default, I only wanted the top 10 posts, so I put a limit on the function call and defaulted it to 10. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll use this elsewhere so I figured I‚Äôd make it a little extensible.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const getPopularTags = (posts: BlogPost[], limit = 10): PostsPerTag[] =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const postsPerTag: PostsPerTag[] = [];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    let tagArray: BlogTag[] = [];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    for (let i = 0; i &lt; posts.length; i += 1) {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        const { tags } = posts[i];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        tagArray = [...tagArray, ...tags];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const uniqueTags = [...new Set(tagArray.map((t) =&gt; t.url))];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    uniqueTags.forEach((tagUrl) =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        postsPerTag.push({</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            name: tagArray.find((t) =&gt; t.url === tagUrl).name,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            url: tagUrl,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            count: tagArray.filter((t) =&gt; t.url === tagUrl).length,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        });</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    });</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return postsPerTag.length &lt;= limit</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        ? postsPerTag</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            .sort((a, b) =&gt; b.count - a.count)</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        : postsPerTag</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            .sort((a, b) =&gt; b.count - a.count)</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            .slice(0, limit);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The way the function works is it goes through all the posts and adds all the tags to a giant array. I then use the same <code>Set</code> command to trim that array to unique tags based on the URL slug. From there, I go through each unique tag and create the array of tags with their associated post count.</p>\n<p>At the very end I return either the entire array sorted by post count descending, or the first ten posts sorted. That gets sent to component to be rendered on the page.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>export const getStats = (): Stats =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const posts = getAllPosts();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        PostsPerYear: getPostsPerYear(posts),</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>\t\t\tMostPopularTags: getPopularTags(posts),</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    };</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>\n<p>The final step was to build by <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/stats\">stats</a> page.</p>\n<p>On the stats page, the first thing I want to do is retrieve the stats in the <code>getStaticProps()</code> call.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const stats = getStats();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        props: {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            stats,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    };</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Returning that to the page I then created 2 components to display the stats in chart form.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;h2&gt;Posts Per Year&lt;/h2&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;PostsPerYearCharts stats={stats.PostsPerYear} /&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;hr className={styles.statsSeparator} /&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;h2&gt;Most Popular Tags&lt;/h2&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;MostPopularTagsChart stats={stats.MostPopularTags} /&gt;</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<h3>Posts Per Year</h3>\n<p>Let‚Äôs first look at the posts per year chart.</p>\n<p>The first thing I‚Äôll need to do is to transform the data into something I can use to display on the page. I‚Äôve stolen the CSS from my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/progress/2023\">goal progress</a> page for the charts. Basically I have some <code>div</code> elements that span the full width of the chart container. I opted to have the year with the most posts span the full width and have all the other years span a percentage based on that.</p>\n<p>So the first thing I need to do is figure out the year with the highest post count, or more specifically, what that post count is. There might be a more efficient\tway to do this, but at this point, this‚Äôll do. I go through each year in the <code>stats</code> object and check to see if the count is greater than the current max. If it is, I re-assign the value to <code>max</code>, if it isn‚Äôt, I move on. Once all years are looped through, I just return the highest number that will be assigned to the <code>max</code> variable.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const getMaxCount = (): number =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    let max = 0;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    for (let i = 0; i &lt; stats.length; i += 1) {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        const { count } = stats[i];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        if (count &gt; max) {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            max = count;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return max;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The next step will be to create the data for the graph. Typescript conveniently allows you to extend interfaces, so I created a new type based on the <code>PostsPerYear</code> type.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>interface PostsPerYearGraph extends PostsPerYear {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    percentage: number;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    color: string;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>I end up with a type that is defined as:</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>PostsPerYearGraph {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    year: number;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    count: number;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    color: string;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    percentage: number;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Now let‚Äôs build the data.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const availableColors = [</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    &#x27;#ff0000&#x27;,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    &#x27;#e76000&#x27;,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    &#x27;#ddb400&#x27;,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    &#x27;#15931a&#x27;,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    &#x27;#2659e5&#x27;,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    &#x27;#aa00ff&#x27;,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const calculateData = () =&gt;

I then create an empty array for the chart data. I go through the years and add the data to that array. The 2 complications are that I want separate colors for each bar, and that I need to calculate the width of the bar.</p>\n<p>The color I calculate by having a second loop through an array of colors I wish to use. In this case, it‚Äôs the rainbow (save for indigo)! The percentage is a math calculation. What I want for the percentage is ‚ÄúWhat is the percentage of the current year of the highest count?‚Äù In this case I divide the count by the max and multiply by 100, and then round it using the <code>Math.round</code> function.</p>\n<p>I can then take the data and pass it into the JSX to render to the screen.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;div className={styles.mainContainer}&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    {yearData.map((d) =&gt; (</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        &lt;div key={d.year} className={styles.container}&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            &lt;p className={styles.barTitle}&gt;{d.year}&lt;span className={styles.mobileStats}&gt;&amp;nbsp;({d.count})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            &lt;div className={styles.bar}&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                &lt;div className={styles.innerBar} style={{ backgroundColor: d.color, width: `${d.percentage}%` }} /&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            &lt;/div&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            &lt;p className={styles.barLegend}&gt;{d.count}&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        &lt;/div&gt;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    ))}</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Here I loop through the yearly data returned by the <code>calculateData()</code> function and create the different bars. I use the inline styles to define both the <code>width</code> and the <code>backgroundColor</code> for the bar.</p>\n<p>The end result looks nice.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2023-02-03-building-a-stats-page/posts-per-year.png\" alt=\"The end result of my posts per year chart showing horizontal bars representing the number of posts per year\" width=\"1008\" height=\"802\"/></div>\n<h3>Most Popular Tags</h3>\n<p>The popular tags charts is almost an exact duplicate.

It was the first Star Trek series to have an overarching story across all episodes.

DS9 broke that mold which would occasionally make it hard to fully understand what was going on in some episodes. It was also based on a space station rather than a moving starship.</p><p>It dove into some ethical gray areas and didn&#x27;t have the same feel of ‚ÄúUtopia‚Äù that was often seen in <em>The Next Generation</em>. It didn&#x27;t pull punches. It also had two of the best villains in all of Trek.

            "content_html": "\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Well, 2022 is now over and done with, and I don&#x27;t feel like much has changed.</p>\n<h2>Looking Back at 2022</h2>\n<p>Not much of anything of note really happened in 2022. It&#x27;s not a bad thing, boring can be good. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s really not all that much to say about it.</p>\n<p>Since Lauren and I were both vaccinated and boosted, we cautiously re-entered the world a little more. We ended up spending a week at the end of March in Cape May for Lauren&#x27;s birthday. Spent a long weekend in New York City in June for my birthday, and then our week-long vacation in Cape May again in September.</p>\n<h3>Side Projects</h3>\n<p><strong>Digital Family Cookbook</strong> - Brought this to near completion. I have a few loose ends to tie up, and I&#x27;m probably going to really clean up the UI design. I only spent so much time during the creation on its rough edges. It was also the first project I got real, working integration tests going. Since it uses Entity Framework, I was able to use an In-Memory database to handle the tests. I even caught a bug or two I would&#x27;ve introduced to the code from running the tests.</p>\n<p>I have the domain for it and I&#x27;m considering trying out <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> to build the homepage.</p>\n<p><strong>Fitness Tracker (Name TBD)</strong> - I ended up restarting this from scratch after working through some of the challenges I had building Digital Family Cookbook. I had chosen <a href=\"https://mui.com/\">MUI</a> for my first version and while it was fine, I decided to switch over to <a href=\"https://ant.design/\">Ant Design</a> like I&#x27;ve been using at work and for Digital Family Cookbook. I&#x27;ve become more familiar with it and figure it would help improve my ability to meet the challenges I face at work.</p>\n<h3>Fitness</h3>\n<p><strong>Hockey</strong> - I played a lot of hockey in 2022. I&#x27;m currently on 3 teams. Goalie in the lower league, and a skater in the more competitive leagues. I&#x27;m hoping that as I play more in net, I can start to become a decent option between the pipes in the upper leagues.</p>\n<p><strong>Running</strong> - I unfortunately was unable to run the marathon this year as my legs weren&#x27;t cooperating. I deferred my registration for 2023, so I&#x27;m hoping to get some long(ish) runs in during the spring and early summer months to get myself ready to start training again. I did end up running 375 miles in 2022, so not shabby.</p>\n<p><strong>Biking</strong> - I never ended up doing much biking. Stationary setup I have can get boring and when I wanted to do something outside, I just ended up going for a run.</p>\n<p><strong>Lifting</strong> - I got soooo close to the 1,000 lbs. club this year. I maxed out at 985 lbs. (235 on bench, 365 on squats, &amp; 385 on deadlifts). Either way, I felt like I was able to get stronger. My marathon training sort of reset my progress, but I started working my way back up.</p>\n<h3>PC Gaming</h3>\n<p>In July I ended up rebuilding my PC. The old desktop just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore for gaming so I ended up building a new one. I still had a semi-decent graphics card (GTX 1060) in it, so I kept that. But I now have a brand new PC with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core 3.8GHz CPU with 32GB of RAM. I&#x27;ve ended up playing a lot of World of Warcraft Classic on it, but am planning on hitting up my massive backlog of games over the next year.</p>\n<h2>Visiting my 2022 Goals</h2>\n<p>I didn&#x27;t do a fantastic job of reaching <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/progress/2022\">my goals</a> this past year. And while I wish I had hit all of them, I&#x27;m actually not that upset about missing them as I got pretty close to a lot of them.</p>\n<h3>Goal #1: Run More &amp; Start Biking More</h3>\n<p>My goal to start biking more never got off the ground. I have the stationary bike converter kit for my actual road bike, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying to set up and it&#x27;s boring to ride. I often just ended up skipping it in favor of either a run or lifting.</p>\n<p>In terms of running, didn&#x27;t quite hit my goal of 400 miles. I topped off at 375 miles so I missed it by 25. Did increase my yearly miles from 2021 by 50.</p>\n<h3>Goal #2: Bench Press, Squat &amp; Deadlift PRs</h3>\n<p>I managed to surpass my squats goal by 15 lbs. maxing out at 365. Deadlifts and bench press I missed by 15 lbs. Still a new PR for deadlifts. Getting COVID at the end of May messed my rhythm up and then having to lessen my strength training in favor of marathon training was the final nail in the coffin.</p>\n<h3>Goal #3: Max Out My Retirement Accounts</h3>\n<p>I got so darned close to this one. I had my IRA maxed out in June, but was just under $1,000 left on my 401k.</p>\n<h3>Goal #4: Read 30 Books</h3>\n<p>I got 2/3 of the way through my reading goal having read 20 books, 16 of them being non-fiction. For the last few months of the year I&#x27;ve been spending late nights after hockey reading. My adrenaline levels after hockey games are too high to go to sleep, so I&#x27;ve been sitting out on the couch for 30 minutes to an hour reading to be in a better place for sleep. It&#x27;s allowed me to read more and solves the tossing and turning problem after hockey games.</p>\n<h3>Goal #5: Write 10 Technical Blog Posts</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;m always worried about sounding stupid with my writing as I don&#x27;t want to say something that ends up being completely wrong. I was able to put the fear aside a little bit more this year and managed to write 7 posts of a technical nature. Not quite the 10 I was aiming for though.</p>\n<h2>2023 Goals</h2>\n<h3>Goal #1 - Learn (Re-Learn?) Guitar</h3>\n<p>Back in high school I got an electric guitar and took some lessons but didn&#x27;t have the fortitude to stick with it. I&#x27;m hoping to find some YouTube videos or lessons from somewhere else to get back into playing. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to quantify this as a goal, but would love to start playing more.</p>\n<h3>Goal #2 - Read 30 Books</h3>\n<p>Same as last year. I&#x27;m hoping to use the post-hockey-pre-sleep time to read more of my reading list. My reading list is currently sitting at 74 and is always growing.</p>\n<h3>Goal #3 - Write 12 Technical Posts</h3>\n<p>I know I didn&#x27;t hit my goal of 10 last year, but I&#x27;m hoping to increase this as I do more work with my fitness tracker app and any tutorials I do to learn other languages and frameworks.</p>\n<h3>Goal #4 - Hit the 1,000 lbs. Club</h3>\n<p>The 1,000 lbs. club is for those who can lift a total of 1,000 lbs. across bench press, squats, &amp; deadlifts. It doesn&#x27;t matter what weights each of them are at so long as the total equals 1,000 lbs. I was 15 lbs. shy last year and am hoping to finally surpass it.</p>\n<h3>Goal #5 - Bike &amp; Run 400 Miles Each</h3>\n<p>Running shouldn&#x27;t be an issue here given how close I was last year and that I&#x27;m going to attempt a marathon again. With biking, I just need to kill the excuses and see if I can&#x27;t find a better way to make stationary biking a little more tolerable. I do have a large podcast episode backlog that could help.</p>\n<h3>Goal #6 - Take More Photos</h3>\n<p>I haven&#x27;t taken my 60D out in a long while. In 2023, I would like to do more photography. My goal is to get in 5 good photo shoots. I&#x27;m not sure where. Maybe Cape May, Valley Forge, or anywhere else that might be interesting. Maybe it will help me find a good workflow for my photograph processing as well.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Here&#x27;s hoping that I can make some good progress on them.

The first and last week of the month I was knocked on my ass with a cough and a nose running more than a faucet. Tested negative for COVID thankfully, so just annoying bugs I had to deal with...twice.</p>\n<h2>Christmas with Family</h2>\n<p>Thankfully the colds sort of surrounded Christmas and didn‚Äôt occur on the actual holiday.

Beware, there are spoilers ahead, so don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-12-27-star-trek-generations-is-underrated/generations.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for Star Trek Generations featuring the images of Kirk and Picard with the Enterprise D\" width=\"1200\" height=\"779\"/></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111280/\">Star Trek Generations</a> came out in 1994 and is the first of the Star Trek movies to feature the Next Generation crew. As a Star Trek fan, I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of love. There&#x27;s a lot of fans who seem to dislike the movie. Some of their reasons aren&#x27;t unreasonable, but I still feel like it get&#x27;s overlooked a little too much.</p>\n<p>The main plot of the movie is that there&#x27;s a scientist, Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell) is trying to enter <em>The Nexus</em>, another dimension that is described as ‚Äúbeing inside joy‚Äù. Soran went so far as to destroy a star to accomplish this goal and that is what Picard and the crew of the Enterprise are trying to stop. In the process, Picard meets up with Captain Kirk from the Original Series and the two of them work to save the day.</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons I&#x27;ve heard that people don&#x27;t like the movie.</p>\n<h2>The Destruction of the Enterprise</h2>\n<p>The first is that it features the destruction, and end of the USS Enterprise D as it crashes into the planet at the end of the movie. Now part of this is apparently Rick Herman and others wanted an Enterprise that fit better on the big screen and the proportions of the Enterprise D didn&#x27;t fit that mold. Whatever the reason, it didn&#x27;t bother me all that much. Yes, it was a beautiful and iconic ship, but Kirk destroyed the original Enterprise back in Star Trek III, albeit in way that moved the story forward a little more. Either way, I&#x27;m not bothered by it&#x27;s destruction.</p>\n<h2>Kirk&#x27;s Death</h2>\n<p>There&#x27;s no easy way to put this, Kirk dies at the end of the movie. While his death doesn&#x27;t feel quite as ‚ÄúSaves the day‚Äù as Spock&#x27;s death in <em>The Wrath of Khan</em>, it wasn&#x27;t a meaningless death. He died fighting to save the lives of the crew of the Enterprise as well as the millions of lives of the species who lived in the Veridian system. It might have been better if he were on a ship rather than some random planet, but dying in the line of duty feels right for him.</p>\n<h2>When Picard Chose to Return to Reality</h2>\n<p>This is the one plot hole I don&#x27;t get and can see the annoyance. In the movie, when Picard is in the Nexus, he finds out that he can return to any point in time. Why did he choose to go to Veridian III shortly before Soran&#x27;s weapon was slated to shoot off and destroy the Veridian star? If I were Picard, I would&#x27;ve gone back to just after they reached the Amagosa Observatory right after they rescued Soran. I&#x27;d march into sickbay with a security team or two, throw him in handcuffs, drag him in the brig, throw up the forcefield and be done with it. Super easy, no muss, no fuss. Soran is imprisoned and the galaxy is saved. Obviously this wouldn&#x27;t work as a plot point, but it would be so much simpler.</p>\n<p>Either way, I definitely feel the movie is underrated and I always enjoy it when I watch it.</p>\n<p>Besides, any Trek movie is better than Star Trek V.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It makes updating libraries and language versions much easier to do. Companies rely on being able to maintain and update their software.

I do this for two reasons.</p>\n<h2>Disabling Cache</h2>\n<p>First, dev tools have a nice setting that allows you to disable the cache when the dev tools are open. If you open up your browser dev tools, under <code>Preferences &gt; Network</code> there&#x27;s an option to disable the cache</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-12-08-developing-with-dev-tools-open/screenshot1.png\" alt=\"A screen shot of the preferences screen in Chrome dev tools\" width=\"622\" height=\"457\"/></div>\n<p>This just helps make sure I&#x27;m not debugging old Javascript or CSS. It doesn&#x27;t happen too often, but can save some hassle.</p>\n<h2>Catching Errors</h2>\n<p>The second, and probably more important reason is to catch errors and warnings early. While interacting with what I&#x27;m working on, any errors, warnings or other messages of note will often pop up in the JavaScript Console in the dev tools. Keeping the console open and docked to the side allows me to easily see what might be happening that I might not notice. It definitely can cut down debugging later.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-12-08-developing-with-dev-tools-open/screenshot2.jpg\" alt=\"A screen shot of the the developer console open alongside my blog\" width=\"1200\" height=\"765\"/></div>\n<p>And besides, with larger 4k and ultra wide monitors, I have the screen real estate.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I had read several of Cory&#x27;s books and consider him someone who is knowledgeable about the creative industry. So when the Kickstarter campaign popped up in my feeds, I decided it was worth my investment, and a read.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-12-07-chokepoint-capitalism-a-review/book_cover.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Chokepoint Capitalism: How Big Tech and Big Content Captured Creative Labor Markets and How We&#x27;ll Win them Back by Rebecca Giblin &amp; Cory Doctorow\" width=\"295\" height=\"450\"/></div>\n<p><em>Chokepoint Capitalism: How Big Tech and Big Content Captured Creative Labor Markets and How We&#x27;ll Win them Back</em> is at it&#x27;s core a book about how companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, TicketMaster, and others are hurting the creative labor industry. We&#x27;re talking authors, musicians, TV &amp; movie writers, app developers and more, and how they are being squeezed by big tech and other big companies to the point where it can be hard to make a real living.</p>\n<p>I can&#x27;t begin to do as good of a job explaining all of this as Cory and Rebecca can, so I will encourage you to buy the book at your local bookstore, or check your local library. But I did want to make a few points and share some of my takeaways.</p>\n<h2>My Thoughts</h2>\n<p>First off, copyright law in America, and in many countries for that matter is broken. Amazon dominates the eBook and audiobook market. Part of the reason for that is that they were able to lock people into their systems, myself included. All the audiobooks you get through Audible and the overwhelming majority of eBooks you buy from Amazon have DRM attached to them. This means that you can only read and listen to them through Amazon. If you decide you want to switch to a different service or device, all your purchased content gets left behind. You can&#x27;t take it with you, at least not without breaking the law and risking fines and possible jail time. That shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to happen. If you buy an eBook from Amazon, you should be able to transfer it to a Nook if you switch devices, and vice versa. This shouldn&#x27;t be controversial and the law can fix this. Being able to switch platforms would weaken Amazon&#x27;s hold and could help authors and publishers get better deals.</p>\n<p>Second, antitrust laws need to be updated and enforced. Too often antitrust is looking at consumer harm in the here and now, and not considering what will happen down the line when the big companies can corner the market. Cory and Rebecca had this apt quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, the Chicago School had a unique remedy for the problem of monopolists being able to pervert their regulators: eliminate regulation altogether! No regulation, no regulators, no regulatory capture, no problem (somehow, preventing monopolies from forming in the first place didn&#x27;t seem to cross their minds).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There hasn&#x27;t been much enforcement of it late and companies like Ticketmaster have been able to grow bigger and bigger, swallowing up everyone, and then using that size to corner the market. Looking at Ticketmaster, if you&#x27;re a small venue, good luck getting any major acts to come if you refuse to do business with them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>US antitrust law is actually pretty great (and new bills in the pipeline as we write this would strengthen it further), but the US political consensus has been that antitrust is mostly a dead letter, a quirk of history that can be ignored the same way we ignore laws that require you to hire a boy to run ahead of your auto-car with a lantern and a bell to warn horse-riders that you&#x27;re coming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stop monopolies from forming and fostering true competition would certainly help  the creative industry get better deals.</p>\n<p>There&#x27;s a lot more that Rebecca and Cory cover, but you&#x27;d do better hearing it from them rather than me.</p>\n<h2>My Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Reading the book has left me thinking about how I consume media.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been on a physical book kick at the moment, but I still do appreciate the portability of being able to use my Kindle. I have no reason to upgrade at the moment, but I will probably give serious consideration to moving to Kobo or another device when the time comes. I&#x27;m also going to start branching out with where I buy my eBooks. I&#x27;ve generally just bought them from Amazon...because duh, it&#x27;s easy! Now, I&#x27;m probably going to see where else I can buy them, ideally DRM-free.</p>\n<p>One of the other things mentioned in the book is how much the auto-generated playlists from the likes of Spotify can make or break artists, especially those just starting out. While I certainly enjoy some of the playlists that Spotify generates for me, I think I&#x27;m gonna try to look at other websites and services that might help recommend me new artists to listen to. And of course I will continue to purchase the actual records of some of my favorite musicians.</p>\n<h2>One Last Word</h2>\n<p>Again, I would highly recommend everyone go read this book, it&#x27;s fascinating looking at how these companies have put the squeeze on the creative industry. But while I&#x27;ve focused here on some of the issues, Rebecca and Cory do a much better job diving into them, and more importantly, digging into possible solutions. I&#x27;ll leave you with this quote from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The increasing financial precarity that has accompanied these forty years of antitrust neglect is one reason why so many people are desperate and angry, and perhaps also helps explain why they are willing to listen to demagogues promising to blow the system up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because while this book focuses on the creative industry, you can see parallels across all industries and the general population within in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710957/chokepoint-capitalism-by-cory-doctorow-and-rebecca-giblin/9780807007068\">Buy <em>Chokepoint Capitalism: How Big Tech and Big Content Captured Creative Labor Markets and How We&#x27;ll Win them Back</em></a></p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It was not a bad month by any means as I got to spend time with my family for both my niece&#x27;s baptism as well as Thanksgiving.</p>\n<h2>Hockey Injuries are No Fun</h2>\n<p>In mid-November, I ended up getting run into while playing goalie in the upper leagues at the ice rink I play at. Banged up my groin and hip pretty badly which kept me off the ice and away from legs days at the gym for 2 weeks. It could&#x27;ve obviously been way worse, so thankfully it wasn&#x27;t a long-term thing. Just frustrating because the players are better and should have better control over their skating. I expect this more in the lower leagues where players are still learning how to skate.</p>\n<h2>Thanksgiving</h2>\n<p>I ended up spending Thanksgiving at my Aunt&#x27;s house. It was nice to see most of my Dad&#x27;s side of the family. Caught up since it had been a while since I&#x27;ve seen any of them. Turned out to be a nice day too after a seemingly early cold spell.</p>\n<h2>Fitness Tracker</h2>\n<p>I had put this project aside to work on Digital Family Cookbook. I decided to re-start this project from the ground up as I realized the original foundation, while definitely useable, could&#x27;ve been better constructed. Like most of my side projects, I learn more and want to build on what I&#x27;ve learned to build better systems. I have a few more tasks on Digital Family Cookbook, but I should be able to knock them out pretty easily when I&#x27;m in the mood. The restart of Fitness Tracker is also giving me the chance to start from scratch with <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/\">Vite</a> and <a href=\"https://vitest.dev/\">Vitest</a>.

This is the first launch of the Space Launch System (SLS). It launched an unmanned Orion capsule around the moon. While I&#x27;m excited about the prospect of us going back to the moon, I have mixed feelings on the current program.</p>\n<h2>The Excitement</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I love the thought of humans touching down on the lunar soil once again. I wasn&#x27;t alive at the time of Apollo, but I&#x27;ve watched plenty of documentaries about the early days of human space exploration. I remember watching shuttle launches as a kid in awe of them. I was excited to watch the final launches and the completion of the International Space Station. I was excited to see SpaceX launch their first Falcon 9 rockets and eventually launch men up to the space station again from U.S. soil.</p>\n<p>The pictures the Orion capsule is sending back from its mission are absolutely breathtaking.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-11-23-artemis-i/artemis-i-1.jpg\" alt=\"NASA&#x27;s Orion capsule floating in space with Earth in the background\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\"/><div class=\"RssPostImage_credit__RZiyy\"><em>Image Credit NASA</em></div></div>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-11-23-artemis-i/artemis-i-2.jpg\" alt=\"NASA&#x27;s Orion capsule floating in space with the Moon in the background\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"/><div class=\"RssPostImage_credit__RZiyy\"><em>Image Credit NASA</em></div></div>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-11-23-artemis-i/artemis-i-3.jpg\" alt=\"NASA&#x27;s Orion capsule floating in space with Earth rising up above the Moon\" width=\"1024\" height=\"630\"/><div class=\"RssPostImage_credit__RZiyy\"><em>Image Credit NASA</em></div></div>\n<h2>The ‚ÄúHmmmm...‚Äù</h2>\n<p>Launching into space is expensive, there are no ifs ands or buts about it. SpaceX has been able to bring the cost of launches to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) down with its reusability, but it&#x27;s still super expensive. The Falcon 9 doesn&#x27;t have the lift capacity to launch outside of LOE though. The Falcon Heavy has more, but still not the level the SLS has. And later SLS models will have even more lift than the Block 1 model being used for the first 3 Artemis missions.</p>\n<p>The SLS has a nickname of the <em>Senate Launch System</em>. It&#x27;s got the nickname because it seems more like a jobs program than a launch system. The SLS rocket is going to cost well over $2.1 billion dollars per launch. In other words, really expensive. For reference in today&#x27;s dollars, the Apollo Saturn V launches cost around $1.25b per launch, and the Space Shuttle clocked in around $1.5b per launch. It&#x27;s hard to wrap your head around some of those numbers, but they&#x27;re huge.</p>\n<p>The Falcon Heavy by comparison costs anywhere from $100-150 million per launch. Quite the difference.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m not a rocket scientist by any means, but I have to wonder if there isn&#x27;t a cheaper way to bridge the gap between the Falcon Heavy and the SLS to allow for man to walk on the moon and to potentially build a permanent base on it.</p>\n<p>SpaceX&#x27;s <em>Starship</em> is also around the corner promising another heavy lift rocket.</p>\n<h2>Making Sure Science isn&#x27;t Missed</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;m someone who wants to keep the science part of space exploration at the forefront. I&#x27;d be concerned if we relied on SpaceX for all of our human exploration.</p>\n<p>SpaceX is a business out to make money. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If they can help NASA by ferrying astronauts back and forth to the space station, launching satellites, or even getting astronauts to the moon, and make money by doing it, that&#x27;s great. Good for them. I&#x27;m not knocking the profit motive at all. My concern is that profit, resource extraction and everything else will take center stage and the science will be put on the back burner.</p>\n<p>I firmly believe that both science and the business of space can successfully coexist. It&#x27;s not an either-or proposition. I think that&#x27;s the one thing Artemis and the SLS have going for them. It&#x27;s NASA&#x27;s rocket and NASA determines what it&#x27;s used for.</p>\n<p>I just hope we have the drive as a country to ensure that the the science of space exploration continues to be alive and well.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I try not to dump on stuff I don&#x27;t fully understand, but at this point, I&#x27;m kind of glad I haven&#x27;t gotten into the whole crypto craze.</p>\n<p>I remember seeing all this hype over FTX. It was supposed to be respectable. Major League Baseball umpires wore their logo on their uniforms. The Miami Heat played in an arena where FTX had naming rights. FTX was supposed to be trustworthy and not riddled with the scams crypto is so often associated with.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been reading articles and listening to podcasts talking about what&#x27;s been going on and...just wow. John Ray III, FTX&#x27;s new CEO, who was also responsible for handling the aftermath at Enron had the following quote while <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ftx-trading-former-ceo-d2c2b881dc0eb0ec37b454674f446b52\">going through the mess at FTX</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people are obviously going to lose money over this. I&#x27;m not gonna be too broken up about the VC firms or the institutional investors. But still, I&#x27;m wondering how many people who decided to dabble in cryptocurrency used the exchange. People who might not have all this money to lose. Obviously, people should have a diversified portfolio, but too many people have seen Bitcoin rise to incredible highs and they want in. If they decided to use FTX, they will likely not even have the chance to sell low, they&#x27;ll be lucky to get anything.</p>\n<p><em>The Economist</em> had a good quote from their article <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto\"><em>Is This the End of Crypto?</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether crypto survives, or becomes a financial curiosity like the tulip bulb, will not ultimately depend on regulation. The more scandals ensue, the more the whole enterprise and its aspirations become tainted. The lure of innovation means nothing if investors and users fear their money will disappear into thin air. For crypto to rise again, it must find a valid use that leaves the dodginess behind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All too often, crypto seems to be tied to scams and other schemes that leave people hung out to dry. The technology as I understand it is certainly interesting, but the Wild West nature of it all is only strengthening my ‚Äújust stay away‚Äù position.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I remember back around 2000(ish) playing around with building websites in Geocities and Front Page. Going from the clunky, old-school direct properties on the DOM elements to now using CSS stylesheets is such an improvement.</p><p>There are now so many new CSS properties, functions and selectors that I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head around all of them. Making them scale in a large web application is no easy task.</p><blockquote>\n<p>No tool is perfect, and every project and team is different. Whatever approach is taken, establishing foundations that bridge the design gap is a key element to scaling CSS.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The article gives a good overview of some of the things you can try to do to make your CSS more manageable, but the conclusion makes sense. We all do things differently, and teams need to figure out what is best and most sustainable for themselves. Take examples from others, but make sure to do what works.</p></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3>üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Software Development &amp; Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://newdevsguide.com/2022/11/13/the-best-csharp-11-feature/\">The Best C# 11 Feature You Don&#x27;t Need</a> <em>(Matt Eland)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tabsoverspaces.com/233907-my-csharp-array-tuple-delegate-declaration-dilemma\">My C# array, tuple, delegate declaration dilemma</a> <em>(Ji≈ô√≠ ƒåinƒçura)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/assertion-scopes-the-one-fluentassertions-feature-you-didnt-know-you-needed\">Assertion Scopes, the one FluentAssertions feature you didn&#x27;t know you needed</a> <em>(Tim Deschryver)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/multi-repository-support-released/\">Multi-repository Support Released!</a> <em>(Jessie Houghton)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelscodingspot.com/asp-net-over-node-js/\">7 Reasons for Startups to Choose ASP.NET Over Node.js</a> <em>(Michael Shpilt)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/\">Craft</a> <em>(Paul Stamatiou)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.dev/web-platform-10-2022/\">New to the web platform in October</a> <em>(Rachel Andrew)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/\">Announcing TypeScript 4.9</a> <em>(Daniel Rosenwasser)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dateo-software.de/blog/improve-your-asp-net-core-controllers\">Learn how to improve your ASP.NET Core controllers with these principles</a> <em>(Dennis Fr√ºhauff)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vived.io/new-hook-is-coming-to-react-frontend-weekly-vol-109/\">Make use of &#x27;use&#x27;

The only slight enhancement is the ability to tell the retriever to parse the return as JSON if the expected value is JSON.</p>\n<p>When you click one of the color or font buttons, the code will save the value chosen to local storage for retrieval the next time you visit the site.</p>\n<p>In terms of the CSS, I take advantage of CSS variables</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>:root {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-1: hsl(144, 100%, 15%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-2: hsl(142, 68%, 29%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-3: hsl(124, 95%, 32%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --sans-serif: WorkSans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --serif: Petrona, Georgia, &#x27;Times New Roman&#x27;, serif;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --monospaced: SourceCodePro, &#x27;Courier New&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --font: var(--sans-serif);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This sets the 3 primary colors to the greens for the default view as well as the default font. To go along with saving to local storage, I also add a custom data attribute <code>data-color-theme</code> and <code>data-font-theme</code> to the <code>html</code> element on the page. That allows me to override the root CSS variables based on what the attributes are</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[data-color-theme*=&#x27;purple&#x27;] {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-1: hsl(301, 91%, 40%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-2: hsl(301, 77%, 46%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-3: hsl(298, 100%, 36%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[data-font-theme*=&#x27;serif&#x27;] {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --font: var(--serif);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The above CSS sets the primary colors to purple when the <code>data-color-theme</code> attribute is set to purple and sets the font to use the serif font if the <code>data-font-theme</code> attribute is set to serif.</p>\n<p>Now the one thing I ran into with the colors is contrast. Colors that contrast well on a light background don&#x27;t always look good on a dark background. So I also take into account the color theme attribute as well.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[data-color-theme*=&#x27;purple&#x27;] {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-1: hsl(301, 91%, 40%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-2: hsl(301, 77%, 46%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-3: hsl(298, 100%, 36%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>[data-theme*=&#x27;dark&#x27;][data-color-theme*=&#x27;purple&#x27;] {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-1: hsl(301, 99%, 65%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-2: hsl(301 72% 61%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --primary-color-3: hsl(298 100% 79%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The top block is exactly the same as the previous CSS block, but the bottom is different. The bottom will also look to see if the <code>data-theme</code> attribute is set to <code>dark</code>, then it should override the top block in favor of the colors that will contrast better on a black background. Accessibility is important!</p>\n<p>You can view the full CSS file <a href=\"https://github.com/kpwags/kpwags.com/blob/main/styles/kpwags.css\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The final piece tying it all together

Other than that, it was mostly a quiet month.</p>\n<h2>The Gaslight Anthem</h2>\n<p>The month started out well, I ended up going down to Washington D.C. to see <em>The Gaslight Anthem</em> with my best friend who lives just outside of D.C. in Maryland. They had gone on an indefinite hiatus years ago so when they announced they were getting back together earlier in the year, recording new music and going on tour, I jumped at the opportunity. The show in D.C. was fantastic, and I ended up seeing them a second time two days later in Philly. If you haven&#x27;t listened to them, I would highly recommend them. They put on amazing shows.</p>\n<h2>9 Year Anniversary</h2>\n<p>In the middle of the month Lauren and I celebrated our 9 year wedding anniversary. We&#x27;ve normally gone to Congress Hall in Cape May for it, but we decided to save some vacation time and some money and kept it low-key. I ended up cooking Filet Mignon and Scallops for dinner and we had a nice romantic evening in.</p>\n<p>The next day we ended up going out to a restaurant the next day to have a dinner pairing with a local distillery. We had some good gin and bourbon drinks paired with some delicious food. We both had pig&#x27;s head for the first time. It was a little on the fatty side, but fantastic. Their homemade barbecue sauce went really well with it.</p>\n<p>We finished our anniversary celebration with a trip to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms home opener. We both love hockey and it was a fun evening. Starting with a trip to Fegley&#x27;s Brewery for dinner and drinks, and then an evening cheering the Phantoms. They sadly lost in overtime, but it was a good night.</p>\n<h2>Phillies World Series Run</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been a huge Phillies fan since I was a kid. Despite thinking they&#x27;d end up collapsing (again) in September, they managed to make their way into the playoffs. All October I&#x27;ve been following along as they swept the St. Louis Cardinals, knocked out the Atlanta Braves in 4 games in the NLDS, and then won the NL Pennant by beating the San Diego Padres in 5 in the NLCS. They&#x27;re currently in the World Series constantly making me both anxious and excited at the same time. They ended up losing 4 games to 2, but the unexpected playoff run has been fun and hopefully they can build off the success next season.</p>\n<h2>Digital Family Cookbook</h2>\n<p>My initial version of the .NET version of my little side project is nearing completion. I was able to get a lot done with it over the course of October. I still have some little things to finish up, but I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll get around to them over the next several weeks. I&#x27;m gonna have to figure out where and how to host it though.</p>\n<h2>Twitter Drama</h2>\n<p>At the end of the month Elon Musk&#x27;s purchase of Twitter was finalized and he is now in charge of the bird site. I&#x27;ve enjoyed Twitter, but for the forseeable future, I&#x27;m not going to be using it. I have re-discovered my <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@kpwags\">Mastodon</a> account, so please follow me there...it&#x27;s awesome.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Round-Up</h2>\n<p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Running:</strong> I ran a measly 3.78 miles in October...I should get back on the road more even without the marathon</li>\n<li><strong>Biking:</strong> Nope</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lifting</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No new PRs or even really close to a new PR in any of the major lifts, but I&#x27;ve gotten back into some consistency lifting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üìö Reading</strong></p>\n<p><em>Continuing</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-data-detective-ten-easy-rules-to-make-sense-of-statistics/9780593084663\">The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics</a> by Tim Harford</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Started</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/chokepoint-capitalism-how-big-tech-and-big-content-captured-creative-labor-markets-and-how-we-ll-win-them-back/9780807007068\">Chokepoint Capitalism</a> by Rebecca Giblin &amp; Cory Doctorow</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>‚úçüèª Writing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Started back with my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/10/14/reading-log-october-14-1\">weekly</a> <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/10/21/reading-log-october-21-2\">reading</a> <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/10/28/reading-log-october-28-3\">logs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üéÆ Gaming</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continued to play <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic\">World of Warcraft</a></li>\n<li>Continuing <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-fallen-order\">Jedi: Fallen Order</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üì∫¬†Watched</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finished watching <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/\">The Office</a></li>\n<li>Finished the current season of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9184820/\">Star Trek: Lower Decks</a></li>\n<li>Continuing <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/\">Yellowstone</a></li>\n<li>Started <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118298/\">Daria</a></li>\n<li>Started <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/\">It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></li>\n</ul>\n            </div>\n        ",

It&#x27;s been a manual process where I open up Photoshop and manually update the text. I wanted to change that to make it faster for me to create, so I wrote up a quick .NET console app to go about doing that and will share with you how to build your own.</p>\n<p>The first thing I had to do was build the template.

I prompt the user to enter the data, and use the <code>Console.ReadLine()</code> function to assign the entered value to a variable. The only slight complication is to handle the date.

If for whatever reason it fails, it should still be <code>null</code> so I error out and exit.</p>\n<h2>Writing the text on the image</h2>\n<p>The next step is to actually go about adding the text to the image. To keep <code>Main</code> clean, I&#x27;m going to create a function called <code>BuildImage</code> to do the image and text manipulation.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>static async Task BuildImage()</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>{</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The first thing we&#x27;re going to want to do is load the template image. To do that, we&#x27;ll use SixLabor Image library to do that. My template image is called <code>Template.jpg</code> and it is in the project&#x27;s root directory.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>using var image = Image.Load(&quot;Template.jpg&quot;);</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This will load the image into memory so that we can overlay the text on it.</p>\n<p>The next step is to load our fonts. I use the <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans\">Work Sans font</a> and have the variable font file <code>worksans.ttf</code> stored in my root directory as well.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var fontCollection = new FontCollection();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>fontCollection.Add(&quot;worksans.ttf&quot;);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>if (fontCollection.TryGet(&quot;Work Sans&quot;, out FontFamily family))</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>{</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This code looks to grab the font file and create the font family object the image library can use to write to the image.</p>\n<p>The next step is to write the title of the post to the image.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var font = family.CreateFont(60, FontStyle.Bold);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var options = new TextOptions(font)</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>{</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    Origin = new PointF(40, 60),</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    WrappingLength = 600,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var rect = TextMeasurer.Measure(data.Title, options);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>image.Mutate(x =&gt; x.DrawText(options, data.Title, Color.White));</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The first step is to create the font I want to use. In this case I want to use the Work Sans font I defined above with the size 60pt and bolded.</p>\n<p>The second step here is to define the font styling. The origin is the <code>(x, y)</code> coordinate of the template image you want to start drawing to. For me, I had to open up Photoshop to determine this point. The wrapping length is the number of pixels you want the text to go before it wraps to the next line. In my case, I want it to span 600 pixels before wrapping. The horizontal alignment should be pretty self-explanitory. I want the text to align to the left.</p>\n<p>The next step is where I draw the rectangle where the text is written. It takes two arguments. The first is the text I&#x27;m writing, in this case the title of the post. The second argument is the options for the font. This way it can calculate what size the rectangle is that is holding the title of the post on the image. You&#x27;ll see where I use this later.</p>\n<p>The final step here is to apply the mutation to the image. In this case, I&#x27;m telling ImageSharp to draw the title of the post on the image with the text options I defined in the color white.</p>\n<p>For my social image, I also want the URL of the post displayed in the image, so I repeat this for the URL.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var urlFont = family.CreateFont(24, FontStyle.Regular);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var urlOptions = new TextOptions(urlFont)</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>{</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    Origin = new PointF(40, 80 + rect.Height),</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    WrappingLength = 600,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>image.Mutate(x =&gt; x.DrawText(urlOptions, data.Url, Color.White));</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Again, I create the font, this time with size 24pt and not bolded.</p>\n<p>I also create the Text options, only this time I specify the Y coordinate as the <code>height of the title box</code> + <code>80</code> to give it some padding. This is why I created the <code>rect</code> object above. I&#x27;m not always going to be sure how much space the title is going to take up as my blog post titles vary. The <code>rect</code> object will tell me how much height the title will take up, then I add an additional 80 pixels to give it some space.</p>\n<p>This is the final piece of text I&#x27;m writing, so I don&#x27;t need to bother creating another rectangle. The final part is writing this bit to the image.</p>\n<p>You&#x27;ll also notice here is where I use the <code>Url</code> property of the <code>PostData</code> class.</p>\n<h2>Saving the image to disk</h2>\n<p>The final step of the process is to save the image to disk so it can be used.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>using var ms = new MemoryStream();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>await image.SaveAsync(ms, new JpegEncoder());</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>var imageData = ms.ToArray();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>await image.SaveAsJpegAsync(BuildFilePath());</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>I create a <code>MemoryStream</code>, and then save the image with the 2 mutations to the <code>MemoryStream</code> using the JPEG encoder. The next step is to then save it to disk using the <code>image.SaveAsJpegAsync()</code> function. To save myself so time, I created a function called <code>BuildFilePath()</code> that creates the directory and returns the path.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>static string BuildFilePath()</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>{</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    if (data is null)</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        throw new Exception(&quot;Post Data is null&quot;);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    string rootDirectory = string.Empty;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.OSX))</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        rootDirectory = &quot;/Users/keith/Developer/kpwags.com/public/images/posts&quot;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    else if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        rootDirectory = @&quot;C:\\Users\\keith\\Developer\\kpwags.com\\public\\images\\posts&quot;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    else</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        throw new Exception(&quot;Invalid Operating System&quot;);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    var directory = Path.Join(rootDirectory, data.Directory);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    if (!Directory.Exists(directory))</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        Directory.CreateDirectory(directory);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return Path.Join(directory, &quot;social-image.jpg&quot;);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This has a little bit of hard-coding as it&#x27;s specific to my enviroments and it might be useful to put some of this in an <code>appsettings.json</code> file, but for now, It&#x27;s just spelled out.</p>\n<p>Since I will sometimes be on Windows when I work, I wanted to make sure this works on either. I use the <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices</code> library to check the operating system I&#x27;m using and assign the root directory based on that. I want this to go to where my blog is hosted so there&#x27;s no additional steps I need to take to publish. This is the hardcoding that could be moved to a config file.</p>\n<p>Now that the directory is defined, I check to see if it exists, and if it doesn&#x27;t, I create it.

There are also now the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0\">minimal APIs</a> that can make things super simple.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day though, I feel this is kind of a personal taste thing with no &quot;right&quot; answer. Both Node.js and .NET are fantastic platforms to get up and running with so companies and developers should really go with whichever they&#x27;re more comfortable with. Good code can be written for either.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://frontendmastery.com/posts/the-new-wave-of-javascript-web-frameworks/\">The new wave of Javascript web frameworks</a> <em>(Frontend Mastery)</em></p>\n<p>I remember building my first true interactive web app using PHP close to 15 years ago.

Mid-September that changed and 2 of the 3 leagues have started back up with the 3rd starting up mid-October.</p>\n<h2>Vacation</h2>\n<p>In the middle of the month, I went on vacation to Cape May, New Jersey. It was a glorious week where I relaxed, checked out the local breweries and wineries, read a bunch, and just re-charged. I was sad to see it end, but super glad to be back in my own bed.</p>\n<h2>Not Running the Marathon</h2>\n<p>I hate quitting and giving up on things, but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the marathon is not going to happen for me this year. My long runs have not been going well and I&#x27;m feeling absolutely broken after them. I was doing well on my medium (6-7 miles) runs, but the long 13+ mile runs were becoming too much for me. I was looking forward to trying to beat 5 hours, but at the end of the day, the toll it was putting on my body just wasn&#x27;t worth it to me. I don&#x27;t recover like I used to.</p>\n<h2>Boosted</h2>\n<p>At the end of the month I got the new COVID-19 booster. COVID isn&#x27;t done with us and I wanted to make sure I got myself protected.

I&#x27;ms starting back up with a slightly new format. I&#x27;m going to have a few links that I go into more depth with my thoughts on and then follow it up with the normal link list.</p>\n<h2>In-Depth</h2>\n<div class=\"InDepthNote_inDepthNotes__Ysj7n\"><h3><span class=\"source\">Techdirt:</span> <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/06/everyones-mad-at-cloudflare-is-there-room-for-principled-takes-on-moderation-when-everyone-wants-what-feels-right-to-them/\">Everyone&#x27;s Mad At Cloudflare; Is There Room For Principled Takes On Moderation?</a></h3><p>This all came to a head at the beginning of the month when Cloudflare stopped providing services for Kiwi Farms so it&#x27;s probably several news cycles behind us at this point. I wanted to share this because it&#x27;s important to think about how difficult content moderation actually is.</p><blockquote class=\"small\">The biggest issue with targeting infrastructure providers is that ‚Äî generally speaking ‚Äî they don&#x27;t have any nuance on their side when it comes to remedies. They pull their services, and an entire site breaks. It does not allow for the more narrow targeting of specific content. It&#x27;s very much a nuclear option.</blockquote><p>I think this is kind of the key point when thinking about content moderation at the infrastructure-level. When looking at services like Twitter and Facebook, if they want to kick someone off their platform, users can just go to a different service, or start their own like Trump did with Truth Social, cesspool it might be. There are even open source solutions like <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a> that would allow someone to quickly setup their own Twitter clone.</p><p>When going after the infrastructure-level, it&#x27;s a lot harder to start your own infrastructure platform like Cloudflare.</p><p>I&#x27;m not saying this to defend Kiwi Farms. That site was fucking awful and the world is better with it offline. But like Mike Masnick talks about, it get&#x27;s messy.</p><blockquote class=\"small\">When we&#x27;re talking about taking down entire sites because some content on them is objectionable, even to a horrifying level, things get really messy, really fast.</blockquote><p>Who determines what is &quot;good&quot; content, and what is &quot;bad&quot; content. It gets complicated and I&#x27;m still not convinced there&#x27;s a good answer. It&#x27;s often very nuanced and there really isn&#x27;t a one-size-fits-all answer. It just gets a little more dangerous the farther up the tech stack you go.</p><p>Mike Masnick continues to go over the issues at stake here.</p><blockquote class=\"small\">The fire department analogy also got me thinking, because it kind of highlights how much of the anger directed at Cloudflare is similarly misplaced. The anger is basically saying ‚Äúyou need to remove your protection, so that we can burn Kiwi Farms down.‚Äù But, the larger question remains unaddressed: why does Kiwi Farms exist in the first place, and why is it left to Cloudflare to determine whether or not the public should be able to burn it down?</blockquote><p>And this is the crux of the issue. We in America are blessed with the First Amendment. The government is not allowed to restrict what people can and can&#x27;t say. Private companies, however, through the same first amendment are allowed to determine what can and can‚Äôt be said on their platforms.</p><p>One final note, I do appreciate the response from Cloudflare. They too recognize how much power they hold at the infrastructure level and don&#x27;t take their responsibility lightly. You should read their <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-abuse-policies-and-approach/\">statement on their policies and their approach</a> to all of this. They talk a great deal about how they handle sites and services that use their platform.</p></div>\n<div class=\"InDepthNote_inDepthNotes__Ysj7n\"><h3><span class=\"source\">Jo√´l Quenneville:</span> <a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/blog/working-iteratively\">Working Iteratively</a></h3><p>I thought this was a good article looking at how we as developers can improve how we write code.</p><blockquote class=\"small\">Before even getting into code, try to break your features into smaller chunks. What‚Äôs the smallest incremental amount of value you can ship to customers? This allows you to ship and get feedback faster while also giving you more flexibility to pause and shift focus to other priorities.</blockquote><p>This is definitely something I‚Äôve done more of as I have grown as a software developer. In my early days I was very much just of the mind to ‚Äústart writing code‚Äù and see where things go. Nowadays, both at work and on side projects, I try to slow things down and break up tasks into smaller chunks.</p><p>Ironically, by slowing things down up front, I‚Äôve found it ends up speeding things up down the line while doing the actual development.</p></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Software Development</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/new-in-entity-framework-7-bulk-operations-with-executedelete-and-executeupdate?\">New in Entity Framework 7: Bulk Operations with ExecuteDelete and ExecuteUpdate</a> <em>(Tim Deschryver)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://code-maze.com/any-vs-count-dotnet/\">Any() vs Count() in .NET: Which One is Better?</a> <em>(Marko Hrnƒçiƒá)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://textslashplain.com/2022/09/12/edges-super-res-image-enhancement/\">Edge&#x27;s Super-Res Image Enhancement</a> <em>(Eric Lawrence)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2022/09/12/jetbrains-rider-net-watch-run-configuration-plugin/\">JetBrains Rider .NET Watch Run Configuration Plugin</a> <em>(JetBrains)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/09/19/when-to-refactor/\">When to refactor</a> <em>(Mark Seemann)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/09/15/why-the-number-input-is-the-worst-input/\">Why the Number Input is the Worst Input</a> <em>(Jared Toporek)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-have-complicated-feelings-about-tdd-8403/\">I have complicated feelings about TDD</a> <em>(Hillel Wayne)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üñ• Technology</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23364696/getty-images-ai-ban-generated-artwork-illustration-copyright\">Getty Images bans AI-generated content over fears of legal challenges</a> <em>(The Verge)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üéÆ Gaming</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340667/destiny-2-eruption-iron-banner-mode-explained-review\">Destiny 2&#x27;s new Eruption mode is the best thing to happen to its PvP in years</a> <em>(The Verge)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üìà Business and Finance</h3>\n<p>üí∞ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/technology/recruiters-tech-layoffs.html\">From Boom to Gloom: Tech Recruiters Struggle to Find Work</a> <em>(New York Times)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üî¨ Science</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/webb-telescope-captures-dazzling-views-of-neptune-and-its-moons/\">New JWST image reveals full glory of Neptune, its moons, and rings</a> <em>(Ars Technica)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üéß Podcasts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/06/techdirt-podcast-episode-328-the-problems-with-the-california-kids-code/\">Techdirt Podcast Episode 328: The Problems With The California Kids&#x27; Code</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"text\">üéµ A Song to Leave You With</h3>\n<h4>TIM - High Hopes</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw0kJMh9SfM\" title=\"TIM - High Hopes\">View on YouTube</a></p>\n            </div>\n        ",

So...much...running.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of August my training for the 2022 Philadelphia Marathon began. I went from running regularly, if not intermittently, to running 4 days a week. My legs were yelling at me all month with having to run longer and longer distances. Thankfully my body is finally catching up and the runs have gotten a bit of easier. The long runs every Saturday are still tough, but this whole thing is a challenge so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;ll be worth it! 5 weeks in, 11 to go!</p>\n<h2>Various Events</h2>\n<p>I started the month going to a Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs (Phillies AAA affiliate) baseball game with my family. It was a fun time, but not for the Iron Pigs as they got smoked. Later in the month I went to a Phillies game that went far better for the home team. I also ended up going to a whiskey tasting dinner later in the month that has gotten me to start trying some new whiskeys and bourbons. That could be dangerous.</p>\n<h2>New Project at Work</h2>\n<p>I ended up getting (temporarily?) put on a new team at work. I&#x27;m now working with <a href=\"https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Identity Server</a> and it&#x27;s a nice change of pace and a new thing to explore which is exciting.</p>\n<h2>Changing How I Journal</h2>\n<p>Over the last 6 months or so, I&#x27;ve been trying to journal what I do every day and whatnot. I started out using a Moleskine notebook and pen, then I moved to Notion, then to my local Dropbox folder full of markdown files, then back to pen and paper...well, needless to say I&#x27;ve had a hard time deciding how I want to do it. I&#x27;ve started using Goodnotes on my iPad with the Apple Pencil and feel like I&#x27;m getting the best of both worlds with regards to physically writing with the ease of technology and &quot;undo&quot; the iPad provides. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, which is no better than paper and pencil, is that there&#x27;s no real way to journal from my iPhone. I can view the notes, but since there isn&#x27;t Apple Pencil support (if I even had it), I can&#x27;t do much more. I definitely enjoy keeping track of what I&#x27;ve done, just need to find a good way to make it easy for myself.</p>\n<h2>New Dining Room Piece</h2>\n<p>When my wife and I bought our house in 2015, our dining room was outdated, but it had an &quot;okay&quot; set of built-ins next to the fireplace. They weren&#x27;t anything to write home about, but they were functional. When we found the wood paneling under the wallpaper and decided to gut the room, we ended up losing those built-ins. Since then, that area has been kind of useless. We&#x27;ve also needed a pantry and some more storage, so we decided to hire a local woodworking company to build us a new set of built-ins. Only this one came with beautiful black walnut sliding doors. Needless to say, they turned out awesome and am so happy that we have a nice piece that is also functional.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-09-07-august-2022-check-in/closet.jpg\" alt=\"beautiful black walnut sliding doors next to my fireplace\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1440\"/></div>\n<h2>Monthly Roundup</h2>\n<p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Running:</strong> Marathon training had me hit 86 miles in August.</li>\n<li><strong>Biking:</strong> Nope</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lifting:</strong></p>\n<p>Lifting 1-2 times a week, not really going for any PRs at this point, though I am trying to inch my way back towards a 400 lbs. deadlift.</p>\n<p><strong>üìö Reading:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/walkaway/9780765392770\" title=\"Walkway by Cory Doctorow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Cory Doctorow - Walkaway</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>‚úçüèª Writing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continued with my <a href=\"/posts/2022/08/05/reading-list\">weekly</a> <a href=\"/posts/2022/08/12/reading-list\">reading</a> <a href=\"/posts/2022/08/19/reading-list\">posts</a> every <a href=\"/posts/2022/09/02/reading-list\">Friday</a>.</li>\n<li>Wrote about my <a href=\"/posts/2022/08/03/marathon-training\">marathon</a> <a href=\"/posts/2022/08/29/marathon-training-update\">training</a></li>\n<li>Wrote about <a href=\"/posts/2022/08/18/upping-our-coffee-game\">Coffee</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üéÆ Gaming</strong></p>\n<p>Been playing WoW a bunch.

I&#x27;ve been having to get up at the crack of dawn to get my runs in before the heat gets turned up to eleven, but I&#x27;ve been doing it.

We started small getting some local beans, but then I got it into my head to look into a coffee subscription service. We ended up going with <a href=\"https://www.drinktrade.com/\">Trade</a> and for the last several months have been getting a new bag delivered to us every other week from various roasters from across the country.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;d like to say it stopped there, but then we decided it would be a good time to get an espresso machine. We ended up getting the <a href=\"https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/espresso/bes500.html\">Breville Bambino Plus</a>. I can&#x27;t say I have any regrets with that decision. Being able to make a latte at home is convenient. It takes a little more work than simply pressing the brew button on my coffee maker, but they&#x27;re delicious. Lauren even was able to make a vanilla simple syrup to up the latte game. I&#x27;m hoping to be able to get using the machine down to a science enough that I can quickly and easily add some espresso shots to my coffee when I need that extra oomph in the morning.</p>\n<p>Over the last several months, we&#x27;ve gotten some coffee beans we&#x27;ve really liked and it&#x27;s nice to be able to try some coffee from shops we otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be able try. If you like coffee and want to give a coffee service a try, I&#x27;d highly recommend it. We&#x27;ve been happy with <a href=\"https://www.drinktrade.com/\">Trade</a>, but there are plenty of others out there.</p>\n<p>Also, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/\">Wirecutter</a> for helping figure out what gear was best for us.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

A small medical mishap, but otherwise a good month.</p>\n<h2>A Quick Trip to Urgent Care</h2>\n<p>My attempts to break new PRs for deadlift and squats ended up getting delayed thanks to a mishap with a garden hose. I had to replace the end of a hose since it got damaged and unfortunately sliced my finger open on the metal ring holding the new hose end. I ended up needing stitches so lifting was basically out of the question. I definitely did not want to bust the stitches open by twisting the skin or anything else that might happen when you&#x27;re lifting hundreds of pounds of weight. I ended up condensing two weeks of lifts into one at the end of the month in an attempt to hit my goals before starting my marathon training. I was able to set a new squats PR at 365 lbs., but ended up failing in my quest to deadlift 400 lbs. I&#x27;m disappointed, but will try to hit 400 in the next one to two weeks before lightening my lifts for when the marathon training really ramps up. I don&#x27;t really want to be going super heavy and setting new PRs while I&#x27;m trying to also put in 30 miles of running in a week. My plan is to lift two days a week, but with less volume than I&#x27;ve been doing for the year. Keep my strength up, but focus on running.</p>\n<h2>Hockey Tournament</h2>\n<p>In mid-July, my ice rink hosted their yearly tournament. I formed a team last year and played and it was fun. This year though, I just joined a pre-formed team so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about gathering enough players which took a bunch of stress away from the event. Our team went 0-3-1, but we played competitively despite never having played together before. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t played hockey before, it can be challenging sometimes to play with a new team since different players have different tendencies. Learning those tendencies and quirks can make teams and players more effective. Not knowing those same tendencies can make things a little more difficult. At the end of the day though, it was fun. Met some new people, played with people I&#x27;ve played both with and against previously, and got plenty of exercise.</p>\n<h2>Journaling</h2>\n<p>Over the last couple of months, I&#x27;ve been trying to keep a daily journal of what I&#x27;ve done, read, and anything else that might come to mind. I&#x27;m just not sure what kind of format I want to use. I&#x27;ve been making a new markdown file every day, but I&#x27;m also considering just using my Moleskin notebook and a pen. To make matters more complicated, I&#x27;ve also considered using my iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil. I&#x27;m still not sure what format will end up winning out, but I find it relaxing and interesting keeping track of my days. With how crazy things often are and how the days seem to blur together, it&#x27;s nice to have a little log to write down my activities and thoughts.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Roundup</h2>\n<p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Running:</strong> Only ran a little under 13 miles this month.

Previously I had been doing it manually, but recently after having listened to the founder of <a href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> on the <a href=\"https://changelog.com/podcast/499\">Changelog Podcast</a>, I decided to try something different. I wanted to use a nice feature Feedbin has to make the page better.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m a subscriber to <a href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> and the one feature it provides is the ability to view the items you&#x27;ve starred as a feed in and of itself. That means that for any article on any of my feeds, when I star it, it gets added to its own RSS feed that is public. I decided that I was going to use that to populate my <a href=\"/likes\">likes page</a>.</p>\n<p>The first thing I needed to do was to create a TypeScript model for it.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>interface FeedbinItem {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    title: string</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    link: string</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    domain: string</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>It&#x27;s a pretty simple model, I want the title, the URL, and the domain.</p>\n<p>The next thing I needed to do was to find a good way to parse the XML returned from Feedbin. Since I&#x27;m using Node, the DOM Parser the browser uses is a no go as the Node backend doesn&#x27;t support it. Fortunately I found <a href=\"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser\">fast-xml-parser</a> which does a fantastic job of converting an XML string into a JSON object that would allow me to easily go through the data returned.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { FeedbinItem } from &#x27;@models/FeedbinItem&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { XMLParser } from &#x27;fast-xml-parser&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>export const getFeedbinItems = async (): Promise&lt;FeedbinItem[]&gt; =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const items: FeedbinItem[] = [];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const res = await fetch(&#x27;https://feedbin.com/starred/starred-items.xml&#x27;);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    if (!res.ok) {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        // handle error logic</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        return [];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const response = await res.text();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const parser = new XMLParser();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const data = parser.parse(response);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    data.rss.channel.item.forEach((i: any) =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        const domain = (new URL(i.link));</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        items.push({</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            title: i.title,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            link: i.link,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            domain: domain.hostname,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        });</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    });</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return items;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The first thing I do in the code is to declare the array of items to return. I then make a fetch call to Feedbin to retrieve my starred items.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const res = await fetch(&#x27;https://feedbin.com/starred/starred-items.xml&#x27;);</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Assuming the call was successful, I create the parser and have it parse the XML into a JSON object.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const parser = new XMLParser();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const data = parser.parse(response);</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>After that, it&#x27;s simply parsing the returned items and adding them to the items array.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>data.rss.channel.item.forEach((i: any) =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const domain = (new URL(i.link));</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    items.push({</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        title: i.title,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        link: i.link,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        domain: domain.hostname,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    });</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>});</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>The only slight complication is me getting the domain or hostname from the article&#x27;s link to add that to the model. For that, I simply create a new <code>URL</code> object and pass the link in and then grab the hostname.</p>\n<p>The next step was to pull the data into the page in Next.js. Originally I was just using a <code>.ts</code> file with an array of my likes. Since it was static data, I just used Next.js&#x27; <code>getStaticProps</code> to get the data from the <code>.ts</code> file and load it into the component. Since I need this to now be dynamic, I switched to the <code>getServerSideProps</code> so that the call is made on the server, rendered on the server, and sent down to the client after.</p>\n<p>I wrapped the fetch code above into its own file to make the <code>likes.tsx</code> component a little cleaner.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { getFeedbinItems } from &#x27;@lib/feedbin&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { FeedbinItem } from &#x27;@models/FeedbinItem&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>export const getServerSideProps: GetStaticProps = async () =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const data = await getFeedbinItems();</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        props: {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            // only return most recent 25</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            likedItems: data.slice(0, 25),</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    };</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>type LikeProps = {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    likedItems: FeedbinItem[];</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const Likes = ({ likedItems }: LikeProps): JSX.Element =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    // the render code</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>It&#x27;s pretty simple. When the page is to be rendered, it loads the starred items from my custom RSS feed, and passes the items into the React component.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. It&#x27;s a pretty simple thing to setup, and it provides me a way to keep my likes page a little more up-to-date without having to manually add items. Of course it means that the items I star have to be part of an RSS feed, but that&#x27;s why everyone should have a blog of their own WITH an RSS feed.</p>\n<p><em>Edited 8/3/2022 - Typo/Grammar Edit</em></p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Another month has come and gone and I&#x27;m not sure what I have to show for it.</p>\n<h2>Recovering from COVID</h2>\n<p>At the end of May, I ended up getting COVID as I mentioned. Thanks to the vaccine and booster, it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but I&#x27;ve struggled to get back into the swing of fitness. I was in a nice groove, but now I feel a little &quot;off&quot;. Not physically, just mentally. Between work &amp; hockey, I feel like I haven&#x27;t had the time to get my normal lifting sessions in. I didn&#x27;t run as much as I would&#x27;ve hoped as I&#x27;m still getting my lung capacity back. I&#x27;m not rushing into anything as I start training for the marathon next month. Figure ease myself back into it.</p>\n<p>The other downside of COVID throwing me for a loop is that I&#x27;m also figuring this will probably be my best chance to hit my deadlift goal and my goal of hitting the 1,000 lbs. club. I&#x27;m hoping to go for 365 on squats and 400 on deadlifts. That, combined with my 235 on bench press will give me 1,000 lbs. on the nose. Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to try to work up bench press to 250 like I wanted in December, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath. I already hit my squats goal of 350, so if I can hit 400 on deadlifts, and 1,000 between bench press, squats &amp; deadlifts this year, I&#x27;ll be quite happy.</p>\n<h2>The Re-Design</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the month, I released a redesign of the blog. I ended up changing the color and slightly tweaked the layouts. I decided I wanted the home page to have a little more pop. I like the way it turned out. I ended up cleaning up some of the code I used to display what <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/current\">I&#x27;m currently up to</a>, the <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/bookshelf\">bookshelf</a> and <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/movies\">movies</a> pages as well. Still got a little bit to clean up here and there, but I like it so far.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m hoping to introduce a few tweaks to make posting a little smoother and easier over the next month.</p>\n<h2>New York City</h2>\n<p>I ended up going to New York City mid-month for my birthday. The weather was nice and it wasn&#x27;t too hot. Not too much to report, though I was able to go to the Morgan Library and Museum and that was incredible. So many old and classic books, including two Gutenberg Bibles on display.</p>\n<h2>Brand New Desktop</h2>\n<p>After going back and forth for the last few months, I finally ended up deciding to build a brand new PC. I kept my graphics card from my old one as well as the SSD, but got a new CPU, RAM &amp; case. I ended up going with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and bumped my RAM up to 32 GB. Took the plunge and went with Windows 11 as well. No complaints so far. Figure I should be good with PC gaming for a while. I can upgrade the graphics card later down the line.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Roundup</h2>\n<p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Running:</strong> Only ran a little over 17 miles this month.

We tell it to use the actual module, but then replace the <code>useParams()</code> hook with a mock function since we need to adjust what it returns.</p>\n<p>In the test, we then tell jest to spy on the router component and watch for <code>useParams()</code> to be called. The spy will then pay attention to if and when it is called, and if it is, return the mocked value of <code>{ id: &#x27;1&#x27; }</code>.</p>\n<p>Now when the <code>ViewRecipe</code> component is rendered the <code>useParams()</code> hook will return an ID of 1 for the test. The cool part about this is that we can set the spy in every test to return a different value for the test. I use <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2021/02/03/unit-testing-with-msw\">Mock Service Worker</a> to mock my API calls, so the different ID values can trigger different data returns.</p>\n<p>So there you go, a nice easy way to write tests when your components rely on React Router and the <code>useParams()</code> hook.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I didn&#x27;t do much because I was exposed to COVID‚Ä¶and then got COVID later in the month. Needless to say, the month could have gone better, but it could have been far worse.</p>\n<h2>COVID</h2>\n<p>Getting the COVID part over with‚Ä¶early in the month, my wife and I ended up getting exposed to COVID. We opted to play it safe and isolated ourselves up in the house for 3-4 days to make sure we didn&#x27;t have it or spread it to others. We never got it‚Ä¶then later in the month happened. I got it, presumably from hockey, and while I holed myself up in the basement trying to protect my wife from it, failed at that too. While certainly not pleasant, both of us are fine now and thankfully only had to deal with mild symptoms. Being vaccinated and boosted certainly helped keep us out of the hospital and alive.</p>\n<h2>Data &amp; Office Clean-Up</h2>\n<p>Earlier in the month I decided to delve back into Linux by putting the latest version of Fedora on my desktop to dual boot. I was hoping to extend its life a little bit, but even with Fedora, it is seemingly a little on the sluggish side. I&#x27;ll have to play around with it a little bit to see if I can figure out what&#x27;s going on. It was beneficial though because it allowed me to pull the data off my old server&#x27;s hard drives. I used to run a file server on an old desktop computer. Sadly it died and all my data was just sitting around on the hard drives. I recently bought a Synology NAS and spent the better part of a weekend pulling data off the old drives and put them onto my NAS. I have to do some organization, but at least the data is now accessible.</p>\n<h2>Fitness News</h2>\n<p>I also finally made the decision to run the 2022 Philadelphia Marathon. I&#x27;ve been going back and forth on it, and finally decided to run it in an attempt to run a sub-5 hour marathon. I&#x27;ll have to trim 15 minutes from my 2015 time, but I think it&#x27;s doable. Official training starts in August, but I&#x27;m gonna try to slowly up the distance prior.</p>\n<p>I also ended up hitting new PRs on both deadlifts and squats. Managed 385 lbs. on deadlifts, and hit my 350 lbs. goal on squats. Yay me! I ended up stalling on bench press so hopefully I can get that going again in June. Want to try to hit my goals by the time marathon training kicks in.</p>\n<h2>Stage Fright</h2>\n<p>I volunteered to give a presentation on unit testing to my company&#x27;s development department. I was nervous as all get-out, but managed to do it. Probably could&#x27;ve done a little better, but it didn&#x27;t go bad.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Roundup</h2>\n<p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Running:</strong> Only ran a little over 23 miles this month.</li>\n<li><strong>Biking:</strong> Nope</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lifting:</strong> Ended up setting new PRs on both deadlifts (385 lbs.) &amp; squats (350 lbs.)</p>\n<p><strong>üìö Reading:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-passion-economy-the-new-rules-for-thriving-in-the-twenty-first-century/9780804172776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">The Passion Economy</a> - Finished this one.

For those unfamiliar, the <code>ISNULL</code> function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is the value you want to use. The function will check to see if it is <em>null</em>. If it is not null, it will return that value. If it is NULL, then it will return the second argument as the value.</p>\n<p>What that means for the procedure is that we can now pass in any subset of parameters we need to, save for <code>RecipeId</code> (the primary key) and it will update the table leaving the values not passed to the stored procedures untouched.</p>\n<p>The downside is that this only works with Microsoft SQL Server, but since that&#x27;s what I primarily use, it works out for me. For those using MySQL, you can still use the <code>ISNULL</code> function, but it only takes 1 argument and will return 1 (true) or 0 (false) if the value is <em>null</em>. You can add that to an IF statement, but it&#x27;s not quite as clean.</p>\n<p>The more you write code, the more you learn!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

While I agree with him in many aspects, I think there&#x27;s more to it and I believe they have their place. A framework can make it easier to handle re-inventing some the wheels with controls, or trying to unify the look and feel of a bunch of different 3rd party control libraries. While I like to build my own stuff sometimes to learn how to things work, there is something to be said for letting a polished library handle it. You still have to learn how to put it all together. <span class=\"domain-name\">(smashingmagazine.com)</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cagrimmett.com/thoughts/2022/04/26/why-blog/\"><strong>Why Blog?</strong></a> - I&#x27;m not sure how many people read this, but Chuck nails a lot of the reasons why I still have my blog and try to continue writing. <span class=\"domain-name\">(cagrimmett.com)</span></p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I spent a lot of it just hanging around the house working on my blog and side projects.</p>\n<p>I started the month by beating the Halo Infinite campaign. Despite the community&#x27;s lackluster view of it, I mostly enjoyed it. Parts of it reminded me of FarCry 5, others definitely had the classic Halo feel. There were definitely some repetitive parts that probably could&#x27;ve been spiced up some, and maybe made the open world part a little more open, but I still enjoyed it. The story had some holes to it, but lived up to the game&#x27;s name and left open parts for future expansions or games.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of April, <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/04/26/there-goes-the-neighborhood\">Elon Musk bought Twitter and that began me seriously reconsidering how much of my time I will spend there</a>. I haven&#x27;t made any firm decision yet, but I did use that as an excuse to clean up some things on my blog. I had noticed some bugs so I spent some time fixing them. The main one was my RSS feed. I had properly built my blog to support MDX, but my RSS feed didn&#x27;t know what to do with it and rendered custom components as if they were HTML components. You can imagine that didn&#x27;t turn out the way it should have. I got that squared away for the most part. Styling isn&#x27;t perfect in the feed, but the content is rendered properly. I might try to play around with it some in the hopes of getting feed readers to preview it better, but I&#x27;m also not sure how worth it the venture would be. I also ended up adding a font toggle in the footer to allow for users to switch between sans, serif &amp; monospaced fonts. Why? Because why not?</p>\n<h2>Monthly Roundup</h2>\n<p><strong>Running &amp; Biking</strong>: Still off the bike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ran another 27 miles this month.

This is where I&#x27;m at now and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever want to go back into the office again.</p>\n<p>At home, I feel more comfortable and generally more productive. It&#x27;s a lot easier for me to get into a flow when I&#x27;m working on a task. I feel like there are less distractions and I can just put my head down and code. I have to be cognizant of not letting my Microsoft Teams notifications distract me too much, but other than that, I can still get my work done in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>I don&#x27;t need to get into all the benefits as I&#x27;m sure many already know what they are. Lack of a commute as well as wear and tear on my car, ability to intermittently take care of small tasks like laundry, easier to exercise over lunch, the list goes on. I enjoy them all while still being productive. I wish more companies and managers could respect that.</p>\n<p>I would find it hard for myself to return to an office.

The guy is smart, there&#x27;s no doubt about that. With what he was able to do with PayPal, Tesla, &amp; SpaceX, he&#x27;d have to be. But through all of this, he&#x27;s also shown his true colors and rubbing me, and a lot of others, the wrong way to put it mildly. This is one of the reasons I am not happy with him becoming the person in charge of Twitter.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of months, he&#x27;s spoken out about how he&#x27;s upset with how Twitter handles their moderation. He&#x27;s seemingly upset that Twitter labeled a few of his tweets as <em>false</em> and that they&#x27;re too restrictive on speech. He says he views himself as a free speech absolutist and has been using this to go after Twitter for how they handle speech on their platform.</p>\n<p>I am all for freedom of speech, I believe that people should be free to express themselves. I also believe that while people are free to say whatever the hell pops into their mind, that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t consequences for said speech. If someone comes to you and starts spewing the most racist garbage you&#x27;ve ever heard, you&#x27;re welcome to tell them to get lost and kick them out of your social events.</p>\n<p>Twitter, like all platforms, has the right to moderate the content on their site as they see fit. If you don&#x27;t like it you can ~~migrate to another platform~~ buy the platform...wait...ummm... Well, I guess that&#x27;s what I may very well end up doing, I&#x27;ve already become a little more active on Mastodon. That&#x27;s the power of capitalism. If you don&#x27;t like a product, switch to another or build your own. People have been upset with Facebook and Twitter for a long while now, accusing it of being biased against conservatism (spoiler alert, that&#x27;s not the case at all). It&#x27;s why we have platforms like Gab, Gettr, Parler and Trump&#x27;s own Truth Social. The fact that they&#x27;re generally filled with racist, misogynistic assholes should say all that needs to be said.</p>\n<p>The concern however is how Elon&#x27;s freedom of speech absolutism will show itself on Twitter. There has been a long history across just about every platform you can name of having to deal with people representing the worst of humanity. Twitter has had plenty of issues with dealing with this in the past, and they certainly have had their share of screw-ups, but it seems like they&#x27;ve recently been doing a decent job of striking a decent balance. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/26/twitters-legal-team-has-been-an-aggressive-defender-of-free-speech-will-that-continue-under-musk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Twitter has even been one of the most aggressive defenders of free speech</a>.</p>\n<p>My concern is that Elon&#x27;s going to relax the rules, and we&#x27;re going to be left with a platform that supports more disinformation and one that allows for even more hate and harassment. I&#x27;m a straight white man and am hardly even noticed on Twitter or any social media platform for that matter. I don&#x27;t have to deal with a lot of the garbage that goes on behind the scenes for others. But I know that others are far more vulnerable and are constantly dealing with threats and harassment online from others, and from bots. Hell it&#x27;s pretty common knowledge that if you criticize Elon Musk or Tesla online, his fanboys and their bots will deluge you with hate. Is he going to consider that free speech? It&#x27;s one thing to disagree with someone, it&#x27;s another to harass and threaten them to the point where they are worried for their life.</p>\n<p>Let&#x27;s face it, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2019/11/20/masnicks-impossibility-theorem-content-moderation-scale-is-impossible-to-do-well/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Content moderation is hard</a>, especially at scale. It&#x27;s something the best and brightest have been trying to handle for over a decade. It&#x27;s not an easy thing to accomplish and so far, no one really has.</p>\n<p>It should also be mentioned that Elon himself has no problem trying to silence critics. He&#x27;ll even go so far as to  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/elon-musk-blogger-tesla-motors-model-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">personally cancel people&#x27;s orders</a> if they criticize him. I guess some people&#x27;s speech don&#x27;t matter much. It makes you wonder if he&#x27;d use his position to go after his critics on Twitter. I wonder if <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2019/03/19/rep-devin-nunes-sues-internet-cow-saying-mean-things-about-him-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Devin Nunes&#x27; Cow would have something to say</a> given what the internet bovine had to deal with.</p>\n<p>Maybe Elon has some better ideas for Twitter. I&#x27;m very skeptical of that, but maybe. The fact that Twitter will no longer be publicly traded might help insofar as they won&#x27;t have to deal with maximizing shareholder value every quarter. But others did help fund Musk&#x27;s buyout so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re going to want to see a return on their investment. His comments on bringing transparency to the algorithm might be beneficial. There might be some upsides, but right now I don&#x27;t see them outweighing the other questionable things Musk has said and complained about Twitter.</p>\n<p>Twitter, and to a lesser extent, Reddit were really the only social media platforms I frequent. I ditched all of Facebook years ago and have mostly just hung out on Twitter. This change has made me start re-thinking that. I&#x27;ll probably peruse Mastodon some (come <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/web/@kpwags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">follow me</a>), but I think I&#x27;m going to start focusing more on maybe writing and sharing here on my blog. I also went and updated my RSS feeds, so maybe I&#x27;ll start to stay away from algorithmic viewing and go back to 2008 with blogs and Google Reader (RIP). On a side note, if you have a good blog and wanna share your RSS feed, by all means let me know.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

The second was an all-grain brew, my first attempt at an all-grain batch which I decided to go with a Red Ale.

            "content_html": "\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>After seeing Git Actions at work at my job, I decided that I wanted to see what I could do for my personal projects with GitHub Actions.</p>\n<p>At work in order for our PRs to be completed, our code needs to match our ESLint guidelines and our unit tests need to pass. I like those rules so I wanted to apply them to my personal projects on GitHub. I knew GitHub had the ability to do the same thing so I sat down and taught myself how to set them up. A little while later, I was able to get them up and running and am quite happy with the results so I figured I‚Äôd share how I did it.</p>\n<h2>Some Background</h2>\n<p>I set this up for my re-write of <a href=\"https://github.com/kpwags/digital-family-cookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Digital Family Cookbook in .NET</a>. I have my backend broken up into 3 projects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Web API (DigitalFamilyCookbook)</li>\n<li>A ‚ÄúCore‚Äù Class Library (DigitalFamilyCookbook.Core)</li>\n<li>A ‚ÄúData‚Äù Class Library (Digital Family Cookbook.Data)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have a separate .NET Unit Test project for the Web API and the core class library. One for the data class library will be added soon. Because of this, I ended up creating two actions, one to run the API unit tests, and a second to run the core library unit tests.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create the Workflows Folder</h3>\n<p>In your root directory create a folder named <code>.github</code> and inside that folder create a folder named <code>workflows</code>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Create an Action</h3>\n<p>Create a file called <code>unittests.yml</code></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Build the Action</h3>\n<p>Start by giving the action a name</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>name: DigitalFamilyCookbook Unit Tests</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We want each action to have a name that is descriptive of what the action does.</p>\n<p>Next, we want to define when we want the action to be run.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>on:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    push:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        branches: [main]</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    pull_request:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        branches: [main]</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This tells GitHub that we want these actions run when we push code to the main branch (I don&#x27;t really do this, but put it here anyway), or when a pull request is submitted against the main branch.</p>\n<p>Finally, we want to set up the action itself.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>jobs:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    build:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        runs-on: ubuntu-latest</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        steps:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - uses: actions/checkout@v2</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Setup .NET</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              with:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                  dotnet-version: 6.0.x</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Restore dependencies</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              run: dotnet restore</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Build</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              run: dotnet build --no-restore</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Test</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Let&#x27;s look at how this is structured.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We tell GitHub to run this on the latest version of Ubuntu.</li>\n<li>Next, we define the steps to take to run the action. Each bullet point is basically a step in the process\n<ol>\n<li><code>uses: actions/checkout@v2</code> is the official GitHub action that will checkout the code in order to run the actions we define</li>\n<li><code>name: Setup .NET</code> is the name of this step which we use the official GitHub action to setup .NET for the action, specifying we want to use .NET 6. This is important as I am taking advantage of some of the new .NET 6 functionality that will break on previous versions.</li>\n<li><code>name: Restore dependencies</code> is where we tell the action to install the project&#x27;s dependencies. you can see the next line defines the actual command. Just like we&#x27;d do in the terminal on our own machine. We tell the action to run <code>dotnet restore</code> The final part is to specify the directory to run this command in. Since I&#x27;m running the tests for the API project, we specify it as <code>./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</code> which is the path from the root of the repository to where the <code>.csproj</code> defining the unit test project lies.</li>\n<li><code>name: Build</code> is where we tell the action to build the project, again just like we&#x27;d do in our terminal. Again, we need to specify the working folder.</li>\n<li><code>name: Test</code> is where the butter is at. This tells us to run the test command to execute our unit tests. Like the <code>restore</code> and <code>build</code> steps, we also need to specify the working folder here as well.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Final Result</h3>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>name: DigitalFamilyCookbook Unit Tests</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>on:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    push:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        branches: [main]</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    pull_request:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        branches: [main]</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>jobs:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    build:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        runs-on: ubuntu-latest</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        steps:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - uses: actions/checkout@v2</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Setup .NET</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              with:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                  dotnet-version: 6.0.x</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Restore dependencies</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              run: dotnet restore</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Build</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              run: dotnet build --no-restore</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Test</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>That&#x27;s it. It was not nearly as difficult to setup as I initially thought. Now whenever I open a pull request, it will run the unit tests and make sure they pass before I can complete it and merge it with the main branch. I ended up creating a second action file and run the same steps, only with the <code>DigitalFamilyCookbook.Core.Tests</code> project.</p>\n<h2>Bonus: Run the React Unit Tests Too!</h2>\n<p>As an added bonus, I&#x27;ll add how I set up the action to run Jest for the frontend unit tests.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>name: Front End Unit Tests</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>on:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    push:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        branches: [main]</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    pull_request:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        branches: [main]</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>jobs:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    build:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        runs-on: ubuntu-latest</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        strategy:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            matrix:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                node-version: [15.x]</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        steps:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - uses: actions/checkout@v2</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              uses: actions/setup-node@v1</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              with:</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                  node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - run: npm install</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./frontend</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            - run: npm run test</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>              working-directory: ./frontend</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>It&#x27;s very similar to the .NET actions, only in this case we specify the node version instead of .NET, and run the npm commands in the frontend directory.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Over the course of the last several years I&#x27;ve been brewing beer at home as a hobby, but I&#x27;ve been limited to extract brewing. It can turn out some good brews, but I know there is so much more I can do moving beyond extract and mashing the grains myself. I was hoping to learn how to do it before the pandemic, and when my local homebrew shop was offering a class, I signed right up. It was a good class and I am now itching to try my hand at an all-grain brew. I‚Äôm planning on brewing this weekend but it will be one more extract brew before I try my hand at some more advanced recipes.</p>\n<p>Other than that, not much to really report so far.</p>\n<h3><strong>Monthly Roundup</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Running &amp; Biking:</strong> Ran 43 miles and biked 9 in January.

I ended up getting my vaccination in March &amp; April, so that by the beginning of May I was ready to cautiously re-enter the world to at least a certain degree. I still wear my mask while out and about, even before Omicron entered the equation, but it&#x27;s nice to feel comfortable visiting family and having the occasional dinner out. It also means I&#x27;m back at the ice rink playing hockey. So to make a long story short, a small bit of normalcy has returned.</p>\n<h3>General Overview of 2021</h3>\n<p>At the end of last year, I started a new job at Webstaurant and a year in I&#x27;m still enjoying working there. I feel like I&#x27;m learning a great deal and am able to work with new technologies to keep my development chops growing and fresh.</p>\n<p>I ended up redesigning and rebuilding my blog using React &amp; Next.js which was fun. I&#x27;d been toying with the idea of moving away from Jekyll for a little while and when I was starting to have problems getting it to play nicely with my new M1 MacBook Pro, I decided to take the plunge. I still want to write about my experience porting it over and re-writing it so hopefully I&#x27;ll get to that soon.</p>\n<p>With regards to vacations, I ended up taking three trips this year. I spent a week in September in Cape May for our yearly vacation. We were able to check out some breweries and wineries and just relax. In October we went back to Cape May for a long weekend for our anniversary, and in November we visited New York City so Lauren could see Hamilton and we could have some fun.</p>\n<p>In December, we unfortunately had to say goodbye to the bestest boy, Otto. It was an unfortunate way to enter the holidays and end the year, and it still fucking sucks.</p>\n<h2>Looking Back at 2021</h2>\n<p>Last year I didn&#x27;t really set any tangible goals, I just wanted to focus on certain things.</p>\n<h3>Staying Active</h3>\n<p>This one I felt I did pretty well with. I was able to focus primarily on my lifting while getting in plenty of runs and some walks as well. Starting in May I was able to get back into hockey so I had another outlet to keep active. My diet got better towards the end of the year as well so I&#x27;m starting to see a downward trend that I hope I can continue.</p>\n<h3>Improving My Development Knowledge</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;ve ended up making tremendous progress on my fitness tracking app. There&#x27;s still a lot to go and a lot to smooth out, but I feel like I have a good framework in place. This is one area where what I&#x27;m learning to do at work has been helping me improve at home.</p>\n<p>My blog re-write and the setup I&#x27;m starting to look at for a .NET re-write of Digital Family Cookbook is challenging me as well.</p>\n<h3>Continuing to Read</h3>\n<p>This didn&#x27;t go as well as I had hoped. I only ended up reading 9 books this year.</p>\n<h3>Write More</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;m not sure this went badly, but I&#x27;m not sure it went great either. I ended up writing 21 posts this year which was more than 2020, but am not sure that they were as substantive as I would have liked.</p>\n<h2>Setting Goals for 2022</h2>\n<p>Since I&#x27;m hoping that 2022 will continue our trek towards normalcy and hopefully a better headspace, I want to set some actual goals for myself.</p>\n<h3>Goal #1: Run More &amp; Start Biking More</h3>\n<p>In 2020, I ended up running over 800 miles. That was spurred by a 175 day running streak and a good period of time where running was the only exercise I felt comfortable doing given the pandemic. In 2021 I started out biking on my bike trainer and getting some runs in. A month or two in, the biking stopped and the runs weren&#x27;t as consistent as I would have liked while I focused on lifting. I did end up hitting 325 miles on the year which still isn&#x27;t too shabby. I&#x27;m going to target running 400 miles and biking 500 miles this year. I&#x27;ve been toying with running the Philadelphia Marathon this year to hopefully break the 5-hour mark, so if I end up attempting that, the 400 miles might be easy to hit. The 500 miles on the bike could potentially be a challenge to fit in with everything else, but also feel it&#x27;s doable.</p>\n<h3>Goal #2: Bench Press, Squat &amp; Deadlift PRs</h3>\n<p>This year I&#x27;m hoping to set more PRs on the 3 of the 4 big lifts. I want to break a 400 lbs. deadlift, a 350 lbs. squat, and a 250 lbs. bench press. I&#x27;m at 360, 310 &amp; 215 respectively so while it&#x27;s a stretch, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s outside the realm of possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Goal #3: Max Out My Retirement Accounts</h3>\n<p>Over the last several years, I&#x27;ve been really focusing on improving where I stand with regards to retirement. Last year I was able to max out my Roth IRA and I&#x27;m hoping to do that again this year while also hopefully maxing out my 401k at work as well.</p>\n<h3>Goal #4: Read 30 Books</h3>\n<p>My goal this year is to read at least 30 books, with at least 15 of them being non-fiction. Not to knock fiction and novels, but I want to have a good balance.</p>\n<h3>Goal #5: Write 10 Technical Blog Posts</h3>\n<p>Writing monthly wraps and other posts are fine, but I want at least 10 posts in 2022 to be focused on software development and have some substance to them. I&#x27;m hoping by just getting started it will spur the writing to continue.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to accomplish this year. I think all 5 of them are doable. Some could certainly pose a real challenge, but I guess that&#x27;s part of the point.</p>\n<p>Here&#x27;s to a good 2022!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

A week before Christmas, Otto had a relapse. The fluid had built up around his heart again and his vitals took a pretty bad turn. They could&#x27;ve drained the fluid again, but it would have been hard on Otto and was only a band-aid for the larger issue of the (now certain) tumor on his heart. There wasn&#x27;t much more we could do for him and still give him a good quality of life, so Lauren and I made the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to him. Needless to say, it put a huge damper on the holidays. Even now after 3 weeks the house still feels empty. It still hurts and it fucking sucks.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2022-01-05-december-check-in/otto.jpg\" alt=\"Otto in the hallway smiling\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\"/></div>\n<h2>Busy with Work</h2>\n<p>The project I was working on since I started my job at Webstaurant a year ago went live the week leading up to Christmas. Needless to say it was all hands on deck to work out the various kinks and bugs that we weren&#x27;t able to catch in QA or didn&#x27;t have the right data to find in QA. There were a bunch of late evenings working, but things are going well with it now. Despite the seemingly weird time to do a product launch, there were good reasons to do it then and things ended up working out.</p>\n<h2>The Holidays</h2>\n<p>With Otto weighing heavily on our minds, we did our best to still celebrate the holidays. Lauren and I were able to do our Christmas Eve Seafood Dinner this year and hosted her side of the family Christmas Day. We were able to enjoy ourselves which a week earlier I wouldn&#x27;t have thought as possible.</p>\n<p>We were supposed to go up to see my family Sunday, but unfortunately my brother tested positive for COVID, so we opted to stay home instead. We&#x27;re hoping to see them this weekend.</p>\n<h2>Starting Over with Halo</h2>\n<p>Halo Infinite came out December 8th, but instead of jumping right in, I&#x27;ve opted to re-play through the series in story order. I&#x27;m currently on Halo 2 after playing through Reach and Combat Evolved. I&#x27;m planning on playing right through until I get to Infinite while trying to avoid spoilers.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p><strong>Staying Active:</strong> Had plenty of hockey this month, one team made it to the finals and lost in the shootout. Lifting, I set a new PR on deadlifts at 360 lbs. I also ran more miles this month than I had in any month this year and was able to break my goal of 300 miles for 2021!</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> Have made some progress in the next phase of my fitness tracker project.

Lauren and I love going to New York, but haven&#x27;t been there since right before the pandemic locked things down.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2021-12-06-november-check-in/nyc.jpeg\" alt=\"Washington Square Park in New York City at night\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\"/></div>\n<p>It was a fun trip, we spent a lot of it just wandering around the city. We ended up going over to Bryant Park for the Christmas Village. We went over to Queens to check out some of the local breweries. Overall it was just an enjoyable trip. It was nice to be able to go to events there and know that they were checking vaccination status. Made me feel safer to be out and about.</p>\n<h2>Killing Spree!</h2>\n<p>After getting back, I was greeted by being able to download the Halo: Infinite multiplayer beta. It definitely brought me back to my late college and early post-college days of playing Halo 3 online with friends. The game has been a lot of fun. I&#x27;m still getting back into it, but I&#x27;m definitely enjoying it. If you&#x27;re playing, let me know and maybe we can hop on and play a few rounds. I&#x27;m annoyed at how 343 is handling the customizations in terms of having to pay for just about everything, but it&#x27;s not pay-to-win, so it&#x27;s not an absolutely huge deal to me. The gameplay is fun. I&#x27;m looking forward to playing the campaign, but am kind of bummed that co-op doesn&#x27;t come out until May(ish) 2022.</p>\n<h2>Mr. Otto</h2>\n<p>Sadly, the month ended on a little bit of a down note. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving we had to take our dog Otto to the emergency vet and found out (surprisingly) that there was fluid build-up around his heart which was preventing his heart from beating properly. Thankfully they were able to drain it and he&#x27;s back to his old self, but we now need to find out what caused the build-up. Hemangiosarcoma seemed to be the worst-case scenario, but thankfully that&#x27;s pretty much now ruled out. There still could be a tumor, so we&#x27;re going to have to bring him back in for more tests. It was just tough leaving him in the hospital overnight and then having to wait throughout the day Thanksgiving for updates. He&#x27;s home now and happy as ever so if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I&#x27;m gonna go give him some lovin&#x27;.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p><strong>Staying Active:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t too much hockey this month. 2 of my teams are now down to 2 games a month. Was able to get a bunch of runs in and have continued progressing with my lifts.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> Have made some progress in the next phase of my fitness tracker project.

I‚Äôve always appreciated Tim‚Äôs take on a multitude of topics so his recommendation had my interest piqued.</p>\n<p>The book‚Äôs primary focus is to make the reader think about their opinions and consider how they form their opinions and what it might take to reconsider them. For plenty of people, including myself, what we think we know may or may not be as much as we actually know. (See the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Dunning‚ÄìKruger Effect</a>)</p>\n<p>Being able to re-consider one‚Äôs viewpoints is a definitively good mindset to be in. All too often we form our opinions, get set in our filter bubbles, and refuse to change our minds. I know I can be guilty of this myself. I like to think the world works a certain way, and will sometimes need some extra prodding to revisit where I stand.</p>\n<p>I think all too often we have our minds set on why people are the way they are, or that a certain group of people are <em>[insert adjective here]</em>. I know it‚Äôs grown even harder over the last 6 years given the current political climate. Democrats hate Republicans, Republicans hate Democrats. The polarization has become seemingly extreme as of late. The pandemic certainly hasn‚Äôt helped matters either. I know I sometimes have to take a step back and think about those who have chosen not to get vaccinated. I know there are those who are fervently anti-vaxx, thinking it‚Äôs some kind of liberal conspiracy or whatever the hell they‚Äôre believing these days. But then I take a step back, read some more, and see that there are others who are unsure for a multitude of reasons. Some understandable, some questionable, but not at the level of the QAnon folks. It‚Äôs kind of ironic that I read this while the pandemic is going on as one part of the book talks about doctors trying to figure out how to best handle those not wanting to have their children get the childhood vaccines (think MMR, Polio, etc.). As the book mentions, sometimes it‚Äôs just doing your best to listen to each other rather than talking down to them. Sure, there are plenty you won‚Äôt be able to reason with, but maybe, just maybe there are others you can help re-think their views.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I often think about is how it&#x27;s often seen as a weakness to change your mind on things. In politics, politicians who change their views are so often called flip-floppers. It doesn‚Äôt matter why they changed their view, or how long it took them. They changed their view, so they can‚Äôt be trusted. It‚Äôs a shame too, because there are countless good reasons to change or adjust your view.</p>\n<p>Looking back at my life, I think the biggest ‚Äúshock‚Äù for me was going to college. I grew up in the suburbs of Allentown, Pennsylvania. I was raised in a decidedly middle-class household. I was fortunate and never had to worry about how life‚Äôs necessities were going to be taken care of. The people I met in high school were very much the same.</p>\n<p>Going to college, and given Drexel&#x27;s location in Philadelphia, all of a sudden I was introduced to people from wildly different backgrounds. Some who came from more money than I‚Äôd know what to do with, others who had to scratch and claw for everything. It opened my eyes to what others had to deal with and made me re-think about how lucky I was and that maybe I should reconsider my thoughts about others who may not have had the benefits I had growing up.</p>\n<p>It falls back to science as well. I mean think about the scientific method. The way scientists work is they come up with a hypothesis, test it, and adjust their hypothesis accordingly. It&#x27;s a little bit more complicated than that, but it‚Äôs ultimately the gist of it. Scientists follow the science and will generally adjust their views based on the results of their scientific inquiry. I forget where I read it, but I remember reading somewhere that good scientists are willing to recognize when they are wrong just as fervently as when they are right. Changing your mind or re-thinking something as the situation changes shouldn‚Äôt be considered a weakness, but rather a strength. There&#x27;s a maturity to be able to say you were wrong.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I really believe that this is generally a good mindset to have. We all obviously have our convictions and views we strongly believe in. But to be willing to hear and listen to the other side or other alternate viewpoints will hopefully make us better people.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I enjoyed a week away on vacation and felt like I got a lot accomplished.</p>\n<p>Month started off well and I was feeling very productive. It helped that hockey has been on a slight hiatus so I was able to spend more nights at home. I used that time to finish up my blog redesign. I actually just got it deployed and switched over. I&#x27;m now using <a href=\"https://netlify.com\">Netlify</a> to host it and the setup process was pretty easy once I got the kinks ironed out.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of August, I started using <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> for notes.

Even if I end up moving back to my synched Dropbox folder with Markdown Files, I think I&#x27;m going to continue this.</p>\n<p>In mid-September, my wife and I went to Cape May for a week on vacation. We rented a condo on the beach and took a nice week away to do basically nothing. Well, maybe not quite nothing, but it was a much needed break. We ended up visiting several breweries and wineries, and were able to meet up with my parents one afternoon for lunch and some beers. I brought several books hoping to read some while there, but I ended up working on my fitness tracker side project far more than I had planned. It worked out because I was able to get quite a bit done on it. There&#x27;s still a ways to go, but progress is progress. Yes, I spent a bunch of time programming, but Lauren and I were able to spend the week the way we wanted, so I count that as a fantastic vacation.

I mean we&#x27;ve always been at the mercy of companies with their license agreements and sometimes DRM, but now it&#x27;s starting to feel even worse.</p>\n<p>If you go back ten years and you wanted the latest version of Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, or just about any other piece of paid software, it was simple. You went online or to the store and you purchased it. You got the installer either digitally or on CD/DVD, probably a license key and you installed it.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, so many pieces of software require you to purchase a subscription in order to use it. Photoshop &amp; Lightroom can&#x27;t be purchased standalone, you have to buy an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription for $10/month. Office is pushing people towards purchasing an Office 365 subscription instead of a standalone copy. Now apps on Apple&#x27;s App Store and Google Play are getting in on the action. Now, no longer are you allowed to pay $5 for an app, now you have to pay $5/month to have all the features of the app.</p>\n<p>I write about this as I&#x27;m planning on getting back into my photography and am trying to decide how I want to handle my collection. I bought Adobe Lightroom 5 a while back (back when it was brand new which probably shows how long ago that was), but have since switched to using the $10/month Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop Bundle. Now that my old MacBook Pro bit the dust and I&#x27;m starting fresh on my new M1 MacBook Pro, I&#x27;m trying to decide if the $10/month is really worth it for how much I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use it. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong; Lightroom &amp; Photoshop are fantastic pieces of software. They&#x27;re incredibly powerful, and do what they were designed to do fantastically well. The issue stems from having to pay for them in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>Now I want to say unequivocally that I have absolutely no issue in paying for software. I&#x27;m a developer so I understand what it takes to build software and I believe that companies and developers should get paid. My problem with this model is that I can&#x27;t simply buy the latest version of Lightroom or whatever other app or software I&#x27;m looking at. Like others, in the case of Lightroom, Adobe no longer sells Lightroom. All they sell is the subscription to <strong><em>USE</em></strong> it. Cancel your subscription, cancel your ability to use the software.</p>\n<p>A previous example of this is the app I used to use on my Mac, iPhone &amp; iPad. Airmail was my favorite email app for the longest time. It provided a bunch of useful extra features that I enjoyed. I paid for the app on both my iOS devices &amp; my Mac. Then all of a sudden, they jumped to a subscription-only model. If I wanted to continue using the app to its full capabilities (including notifications), I would have to start paying for a subscription. I was bummed, and that was the last time I used the app. I opted to go back to the default iOS &amp; Mac Mail apps. It annoyed me. I paid for the app and it felt like they were playing a bait and switch game. I paid for certain features and all of a sudden they pulled those features away from me. If they had released a new version and required me to pay for the new version with the new features, I would have been much more understanding. At that point, I would simply look at the new features they were offering and see if they were worth the additional money to me. If they were, I would have paid the money and bought the new version. Again, I&#x27;m not against paying for new versions or even new functionality. In Airmail&#x27;s case, I was even more angry because they took away functionality that I felt that I paid for.</p>\n<p>I think another reason why I feel a little peeved about this is that in some of these cases, I feel like there&#x27;s not a reason for a subscription outside of a money grab. Again, take Adobe Lightroom &amp; Photoshop as an example. I can&#x27;t see any reason why someone shouldn&#x27;t be able to be able to simply buy the software to use. There&#x27;s no real reason why it needs to be subscription only. They offer Adobe Creative Cloud and cloud storage as part of the bundle, and if that was what they were charging for, so be it. But I don&#x27;t use their cloud storage. I already pay for Dropbox for my cloud storage and I don&#x27;t really need any of Adobe&#x27;s sync functionality. Let me simply pay for the software and if I decide I do want the cloud offerings, I&#x27;ll gladly pay for them. With Lightroom, I was able to find an old installer download, so I&#x27;ll soon find out if it still works. If it does, great! If it doesn&#x27;t, I think I&#x27;ll give <a href=\"https://darkroom.co/\">Darkroom</a> a try.</p>\n<p>I guess what a lot of this boils down to is that I miss simply buying the software I use and not having to pay a subscription for it. I&#x27;m also worried that this will start to become more and more normal to the point where all of a sudden Windows 12 becomes subscription-only.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

That routine worked well for me, but then hockey started back up and I wasn&#x27;t able to keep up. A new routine was in order, and I chose to build one based on <a href=\"https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big\">Jim Wendler&#x27;s 5/3/1 BBB (Boring But Big)</a> program.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been running it for a couple months and I&#x27;m seeing some decent progress. I&#x27;m approaching my pre-pandemic weights on bench, squats &amp; deadlifts. I&#x27;ve also set a new PR on overhead press at 155 lbs. (I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is 1:1 as I was doing standing overhead press, but now I have to do seated overhead press at home since my basement ceiling isn&#x27;t tall enough). That said, I never hit 155 standing so I&#x27;ll take it.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s definitely similar to how I was running my 6 day program, but it forces me to move up a little faster than I was in the past, which is good. It focuses on the 4 main lifts (overhead press, deadlift, bench press, &amp; squats) and runs on 4 week cycles. It again uses my 1 rep max (1RM) to calculate my training max (TM) (90% of my 1RM) which then calculates the weights I lift.</p>\n<p>For each of the main lifts, the sets are set up like.</p>\n<p><strong>Week 1:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>5 reps at 65% of my TM</li>\n<li>5 reps at 75% of my TM</li>\n<li>5+ reps at 85% of my TM</li>\n<li>5 sets of 10 reps at 50% of my TM</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Week 2:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>3 reps at 70% of my TM</li>\n<li>3 reps at 80% of my TM</li>\n<li>3+ reps at 90% of my TM</li>\n<li>5 sets of 10 reps at 55% of my TM</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Week 3:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>5 reps at 75% of my TM</li>\n<li>3 reps at 85% of my TM</li>\n<li>1+ reps at 95% of my TM</li>\n<li>5 set of 10 reps at 60% of my TM</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Week 4:</strong></p>\n<p>Deload. I basically just do the lifts at 50-60% intensity to give my muscles a break.</p>\n<p>I then up my 1RM for deadlifts &amp; squats by 10 lbs., and the 1RM for overhead press and bench press by 5 lbs., rinse, and repeat.</p>\n<p>The one thing I&#x27;ve been noticing on with squats and bench press is I feel like my brain is holding me back. There seems to be some kind of psychological component to it. Unlike the gym, I don&#x27;t have access to a spotter so there&#x27;s part of me that gets a little scared about the weights I&#x27;m lifting. I do have safety bars that will protect me for both lifts, but I always managed to lift heavier when I know someone is there to help if I start to go the wrong direction. Failure is a part of lifting and I have no shame in saying I&#x27;ve failed lifts on a multitude of occasions, but it&#x27;s still scary when you have 200+ lbs. on your back or over your chest.</p>\n<p>But even with the psychogical aspect of the heavy weights, one of the reasons I like the program is how it has me moving up in weights. The progress is slow, but it&#x27;s steady. I&#x27;m obviously not setting PRs every week, or even every other week, but I see and feel progress while limiting the &quot;scare&quot; factor.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s the routine I&#x27;m running.</p>\n<h3>Day 1 - Overhead Press</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Overhead Press</li>\n<li>Upright Row - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Skullcrushers - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Front Raise - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Dumbbell Face Pulls - 3 sets of 15</li>\n<li>EZ Bar Curls - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Pull Ups - As many as I can do</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Day 2 - Deadlift</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Deadlifts</li>\n<li>Front Squat - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Standing Barbell Calf Raises - 3 sets of 12-15</li>\n<li>Russian Twists</li>\n<li>Ab Wheel</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Day 3 - Bench Press</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Bench Press</li>\n<li>Bent Over Barbell Row - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Incline Bench Press - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Hammer Curls - 3 sets of 12</li>\n<li>Single-Arm Dumbell Tricep Extensions - 3 sets of 12</li>\n<li>Dumbbell Face Pulls - 3 sets of 15</li>\n<li>Chin Ups - As many as I can do</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Day 4 - Squat</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Squats</li>\n<li>Romanian Deadlifts - 3 sets of 10-12</li>\n<li>Standing Barbell Calf Raises - 3 sets of 12-15</li>\n<li>Dumbbell Side Bends - 3 sets of 15</li>\n<li>Ab Wheel</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<p>What&#x27;s your routine, any lifts you swear by?</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It feels like despite the slow start, the year has just flown by. I figured I&#x27;d take a look back and see how I&#x27;m doing with what I&#x27;ve been doing this year, and how I&#x27;ve been faring with what I was hoping to focus on this year.</p>\n<h2>What I&#x27;ve Been Up To</h2>\n<h3>Playing Hockey Again</h3>\n<p>Until May, I wasn&#x27;t fully vaccinated, so I opted to play it safe and limit my excursions outside the house. Now that I&#x27;m fully vaccinated, I&#x27;ve started to go back out into the world. This includes playing hockey again.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m back to playing on the team I&#x27;m captain of. And I&#x27;m playing in the lower league as well. Sadly, I ended up losing my goalie spot as there are only 8 teams, so only 8 goalie positions. I am able to skate out with a good group of guys and girls so I&#x27;m still able to get more time on the ice. I&#x27;m on the sub list so I&#x27;m still able to play in net now and again. I&#x27;m hoping a spot will open up in the fall season so that I can start playing goalie again full time. I played in a tournament this past weekend as the netminder and had a lot of fun. Four games in three days made my legs a little unhappy...followed by a fifth game the next day, but it was totally worth it. I&#x27;m now playing hockey one or two times a week, and I&#x27;m happy to be back on the ice.</p>\n<h3>House Projects</h3>\n<p>The biggest project on my house was re-doing the kitchen cabinets. Our kitchen cabinets&#x27; paint was looking a little run down, and in some cases peeling, so we opted to sand them all down, re-paint them, and install new hardware. It was a lot of hard work, a bunch of cursing at various things, but the end result turned out great. The cabinets aren&#x27;t anything to ooooh and ahhhh over, but they look a lot nicer and will hold off a needed kitchen remodel for the time being.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2021-07-24-halfway-through-2021/kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"The end result of the kitchen cabinets refinishing\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\"/></div>\n<p>I also ended up putting in a raised flower bed around one of our street lights. Again, nothing huge, but I liked how it turned out. Now all I need to do is get some new lights for the outside of the house.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2021-07-24-halfway-through-2021/streetlight.jpg\" alt=\"Adding a raised flower bed around a street light\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1440\"/></div>\n<p>There have been a few other small projects here and there...there always are! (The joys of home ownership)</p>\n<h2>Looking at My Focus Points</h2>\n<h3>Staying Active</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been pretty good with this one. I haven&#x27;t been running nearly as much as I was planning, but I&#x27;m back to playing hockey and am continuing to strength train, so all&#x27;s well on the active front. Diet needs work, but that&#x27;s always the case. I&#x27;ll get there I hope.</p>\n<h3>Improving My Development Skills</h3>\n<p>I feel like this one is going really well. Between work and my side project, I&#x27;m learning new ways of doing things and becoming more proficient in React &amp; TypeScript. Outside of the <a href=\"/2021/06/02/refactoring-loops.html\">refactoring loops</a>, I like where I am at with my never-ending coding journey. I&#x27;m trying to strike a balanace between also continuing forward with my <a href=\"/2021/04/27/switching-platforms.html\">blog rewrite</a>. I&#x27;m also going back and forth with how much I want to redesign my blog while rewriting it.</p>\n<h3>Reading More</h3>\n<p>I could be doing better here. Between late nights with hockey, video games, and other things, I haven&#x27;t spent as much time reading as I would like.</p>\n<h3>Writing More</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;m not unhappy with where I am, but I could definitely be writing more. I have some ideas for some posts, so I suppose I should buckle down and start writing them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Let&#x27;s finish out 2021 strong.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

That&#x27;s sometimes how it feels with the fitness tracking app I&#x27;m building.</p>\n<p>But despite all this, I feel like I&#x27;m farther along than I was a month or two ago even without any new functionality added. How is that possible you ask? Well it really comes down to refactoring my code.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2021-06-02-refactoring-loops/code.jpg\" alt=\"Computer Code\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1704\"/></div>\n<h2>First, a Little Background</h2>\n<p>I haven&#x27;t been seriously building apps in React for all that long. The first real app I built was Digital Family Cookbook. I was able to build it thanks to a course from Wes Bos on React &amp; GraphQL. My issue was that I didn&#x27;t have a firm enough grasp with React and Node.js to really build what I wanted to. While definitely functional, Digital Family Cookbook is a little rough around the edges. Everything works, but it doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;smooth feel&quot; one would come to expect from an app of its kind. At this point, I have the project on an indefinite hold as I try to decide what to do with it.</p>\n<h2>Taking Steps Forward</h2>\n<p>I wanted this new fitness app to be better. I wanted to make sure I had a better grasp of how everything pieces together to make an app that is much more smooth in action. This is one of the reasons I chose a .NET Core backend. I&#x27;ve been a .NET developer almost exclusively in all my jobs. And with how powerful and versatile .NET Core has become, it felt like a great option. No disrespect to Node, but I just feel more comfortable in the .NET ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve also read a lot more into React as well to give me a better foundation. The only wildcard that I&#x27;ve really thrown in is introducing myself to TypeScript. I think I&#x27;ve gotten a good grasp on it now though. I feel like my knowledge of Javascript has put me in a good place.</p>\n<h2>Developing the App</h2>\n<p>From the beginning, I&#x27;ve felt much better about the architecture of the app. The backend isn&#x27;t much of an issue as I have good understanding of C# and .NET. I&#x27;ve picked up on the new features of .NET Core pretty easily as well.</p>\n<p>I also started a new job at Webstaurant Store back in December. At Webstaurant Store, we have been using .NET Core, React, &amp; TypeScript. I have some great teammates and have been learning a great deal about these frameworks as well as some new tips and tricks with how to improve my code. In 5 short months I&#x27;ve already felt like I&#x27;ve improved with all of these tools tremendously. I&#x27;ve also been trying to read more blogs and other articles from fellow developers to try to get a better idea of how others do things.</p>\n<p>This has had its benefits, but it is also a double-edged sword. Looking at my experiences at Webstaurant Store and what I&#x27;ve been reading, I&#x27;ve ended up looking at the code I&#x27;ve written, only to realize that I can make it better. Needless to say, this has put me in a place where I end up in a constant refactoring loop.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don&#x27;t Let Perfect Be the Enemy of Good</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#x27;ve heard this expression several times, &quot;Don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of good&quot;. And it makes sense. Apps will never be perfect. Code will never be perfect. Don&#x27;t wait to achieve perfection because you&#x27;ll never end up reaching it. At some point, you have to have to recognize that it&#x27;s good enough. So far with this project, I haven&#x27;t exactly followed this advice so far. I&#x27;ve been focusing on trying to make sure that I have as good a foundation to build the app as possible. It&#x27;s led to two major refactors that have basically caused me to have introduced no new functionality.</p>\n<h3>Entity Framework to Dapper</h3>\n<p>The first thing I ended up re-writing was moving the code away from Entity Framework over to <a href=\"https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper\">Dapper</a>. This required me adjusting not only the backend C# code, but also writing Stored Procedures to interact with the database. I could&#x27;ve done a lot of it with inline SQL, but I generally feel like stored procedures are the way to go for most calls to the database. I made this switch because I felt like I could get slightly better performance through Dapper and hand-written SQL, and to get myself more familiar with the libraries I would be using at my new job. It might not have been the best reasoning, but I&#x27;m happy where things are. I have a database folder with all the creation scripts that should help me build the database quickly if and when it&#x27;s needed. I do kind of miss the Entity Framework migrations though.</p>\n<p>I might be jumping ahead of myself, but I&#x27;m toying with using EF6 if I opt to rewrite Digital Family Cookbook in .NET.</p>\n<h3>Custom Components to Formik &amp; Material-UI</h3>\n<p>While switching to Dapper took a chunk of time, it was by no means the biggest. I had been unhappy with how some of the forms were working. I was seeing some of the roughness I experienced with Digital Family Cookbook. Not to the same level, but enough that I decided it would be worth it to look into some form libraries rather than my custom built forms. I settled on <a href=\"https://formik.org/\">Formik</a>. The conversion was going so well, I decided I&#x27;d also look into a full UI framework rather than rolling my own. &quot;In for a penny, in for a pound&quot; the expression goes. I decided to switch to using the <a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">Material-UI Framework</a>. I ended up spending several weeks converting all the pages I had built to use Material-UI rather than the homecooked components. Thankfully I had only build out the settings pages so there wasn&#x27;t a ton I had to redo, but you can see where this refactoring loop comes into play.</p>\n<h2>Onward</h2>\n<p>While it has certainly been less-than-ideal to be sort of running in place in terms of functionality, the changes that I made turned out well. I feel more confident in this app&#x27;s foundation and the ability to add the new functionality on top of it.</p>\n<p>Are there still things I need to improve? Of course there are...there always are. I just have to keep reminding myself that I can always come back to it later if it&#x27;s working well. Just because it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;, doesn&#x27;t mean I shouldn&#x27;t try to continue to make it better. It just means that I can move onto what&#x27;s next.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

But recently, I&#x27;ve been giving serious consideration to switching to Gatsby or Next.js.</p>\n<p>I have several reasons for making the move away from Jekyll. Some is pure personal preference, some involves the technology used, and part of it is to learn something new.</p>\n<h2>Missing Features &amp; Personal Preference</h2>\n<p>There are several features I&#x27;ve been wanting to add to my blog. The biggest one is probably search. I&#x27;ve been looking into adding search, and while possible, doesn&#x27;t seem as easy as I would hope it to be. Part of this also comes down to the fact the Jekyll is built on Ruby, which is not a language I know all that well. I&#x27;ve been able to keep this going, but it&#x27;s still a hill to climb. This is the personal preference part of things. I&#x27;m a .NET &amp; Javascript developer primarily, and that&#x27;s where my comfort zone is. It&#x27;s not a knock on Ruby, just not something I want to spend a lot of time delving into.</p>\n<h2>The Tech Stack</h2>\n<p>I also wanted to move to a stack I better understood. I&#x27;ve been working with React for a couple years on the side, and now I&#x27;m using it professionally as well. I thought it would be beneficial and easier to work with if I had a better understanding of the tools &amp; language used.</p>\n<p>Another thing I was looking into improving was my build/deployment process. I host my blog on AWS using their S3 storage. The upside is that hosting is dirt cheap for me (granted there&#x27;s very little processing power for my site, nor do I have many visitors). The downside is that there&#x27;s a lot of caching involved so any changes can take a day or so to be reflected. There are ways around this of course, but I&#x27;m a little cost-conscious and am worried about racking up too large a bill. This can also cause any embarassing bugs or typos (or anything else really) to be visible for much longer than I&#x27;d like.</p>\n<h2>Making the Switch</h2>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2021-04-27-switching-platforms/nextjs.svg\" alt=\"Next.js Logo\" width=\"207\" height=\"124\"/></div>\n<p>I&#x27;ve given it a fair amount of thought and right now I believe I will be starting the design and implementation of my blog using Next.js. I used Next.js with <a href=\"https://advancedreact.com/\">Wes Bos&#x27; Advanced React &amp; GraphQL Course</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/kpwags/digitalfamilycookbook\">Digital Family Cookbook</a> so I have some familiarity with it over Gatsby. But while I have some familiarity with it, it wasn&#x27;t heavily used in either project so I figure this will also be a learning project.</p>\n<h2>The Process</h2>\n<p>I plan on building this out in the open and will be starting with a <a href=\"https://github.com/kpwags/new.kpwags.com\">brand new public repository on GitHub</a>. I&#x27;m going to build it using feature branches (like I&#x27;ve been doing with my fitness tracker) with issues created for most work. Unlike my current blog where I mostly just work off of the main branch, I&#x27;ll be doing this one the &quot;proper&quot; way. I&#x27;m even planning on keeping at it with future posts.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m also hoping to write about how things are going and the progress I&#x27;m making as well as why I&#x27;ve chosen doing things the way I do. I&#x27;ve also been toying with streaming some of the development on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/kpwags\">Twitch</a>.</p>\n<p>There&#x27;s no rush to build this, so while I&#x27;m going to try to devote some time on it regularly, I also want to continue to work on my fitness tracker. So keep checking back as I&#x27;m sure there will be more posts between now and when I officially make the switch.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Alas, I figured I&#x27;d check in with how I&#x27;m doing with my goals.</p>\n<h2>Staying Active</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been doing a good job staying active. I&#x27;m lifting 5-6 days a week, I&#x27;m running more now that the weather&#x27;s gettiing a little nicer. I feel generally pretty good about my activity level. My issue is that I struggle with the willpower to lay off the snacking. Now that I&#x27;m working from home, it&#x27;s a little too easy to just munch on things here and there. I&#x27;m a little disappointed in myself sometimes, but I also do my best to remember that it&#x27;s also not that big of a deal. I&#x27;m hoping to focus this month on trying to stick within my calorie goals.</p>\n<h2>Improving My Development Chops</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;m continuing to learn both at work, and at home. I&#x27;m continuing work on my fitness tracker app. It&#x27;s development is taking a little bit of a roundabout, which I&#x27;m currently writing a post to explain. The important thing is that I&#x27;m making progress and generally feeling accomplished with what I&#x27;m producing.</p>\n<h2>Continuing to Read</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;m on my fifth book of the year and have mixed in keeping up with my <em>Economist</em> subscription, so I&#x27;m happy with where I&#x27;m at. It&#x27;s nice getting into bed a little early, winding down reading before going to sleep.</p>\n<h2>Write More</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;ll chalk this up as a mixed bag. I have a whole bunch of post ideas and some started. I just need to actually take the time to sit down and write them up. A lot of them are more in-depth than posts like this one.</p>\n<h2>Everything Else</h2>\n<p>I ended up getting my first COVID-19 shot mid-March. I am getting my second this weekend &amp; my wife is next week, so I&#x27;m happy to really see the beginning of the end of this thing. Hopefully more people can line up appointments and get the shot. I&#x27;m also hoping I&#x27;ll be able to start playing hockey again soon too.</p>\n<p>I also ended up re-doing my office this past week. I switched from an ultrawide monitor to dual 27&quot; 4k monitors. I have to say I like the extra screen real estate. I ended up moving my ultrawide downstairs to use for work. Since both my wife and I work from home and regularly have calls, I ended up creating a second office in my basement for work so that we&#x27;re not interfering with each other. An added benefit of this setup is that it gives me some separation between &quot;home&quot; and &quot;work&quot;. When I&#x27;m downstairs, I&#x27;m working; when I&#x27;m upstairs, I am on my own time.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2021-04-06-three-months-down-in-2021/desksetup.jpg\" alt=\"My new desk setup with dual 27&#x27;&#x27; 4k monitors\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1167\"/></div>\n<p>My wife and I have now also started to re-do the kitchen cabinets. It&#x27;s a smaller home improvement project, but we&#x27;re taking the cabinet doors off, sanding and re-painting everything, and installing new hardware. It&#x27;s not exactly HGTV-worthy, but it should spruce the kitchen up a little bit until we get around to redoing it entirely.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Still not much to report, but figured I&#x27;d post this to help keep myself accountable. Stay safe out there!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It talks about how sports team owners manage to screw the public out of money to pay for their new stadiums and arenas. In one of the later chapters, I found a quote that I think sums up how absurd it is that we are the ones paying for their stadiums.</p>\n<p>For reference, &#x27;TIFS&#x27; stands for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_increment_financing\">Tax Increment Financing</a>. The short description is it&#x27;s just a finance tool that is often used to make things like stadium deals seem less toxic and more palatable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As St. Paul Pioneer Press columnist Edward Lotterman wrote on the absurdities of TIFS: &quot;My wife and I have often talked about a small addition that would extend the back porch the full width of the house. It would be nice if the government would give us the money to do this. The value of the house would increase and so would our taxes. The higher taxes would pay the government back eventually, so it wouldn&#x27;t cost taxpayers anything. It seems like a great idea, but for some reason the government is not willing to step up to our plate. We threatened to move to Portland or Charlotte if we don&#x27;t get help, but officials just laughed.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#x27;m a big sports fan, and a fan of the Philadelphia teams, especially the Flyers and the Phillies. Still, I would rather see them pack up and leave than spend public funding on new stadiums. That money could be better spent on schools, public transit, and countless other initiatives that would bring a much better return on investment to Philadelphia than a new stadium ever could.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

The pandemic is still gripping the nation, I&#x27;m still stuck in quarantine with my wife. Nothing has really changed for me from say September of last year to now. The only big difference is that it&#x27;s not as fun to be outside right now with the cold and all the snow. Seriously, I think I&#x27;ve used my snowblower more this year than in the previous 5 years I&#x27;ve owned my house combined. But not wanting to be outside doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s the reason this year feels like it&#x27;s been dragging. The weather doesn&#x27;t normally affect me like this, so I&#x27;m guessing the pandemic and everything that goes along with it is finally starting to get to me.</p>\n<p>As rough as it&#x27;s felt though, it hasn&#x27;t been an awful year. I&#x27;ve been doing a good job at sticking with my 2021 goals. I&#x27;ve been enjoying and thriving at my new job. I&#x27;ve been able to enjoy weekends and evenings with my wife. All in all, it&#x27;s been a good two months so far.</p>\n<h2>Staying Active</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been doing a good job of staying active around 6 days a week. My primary activity is lifting, but I&#x27;ve also been bringing out my bike trainer I got for Christmas a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve been hesitant with the cold, snow and ice to run. The last thing I want to do is slip, fall and twist my ankle (or worse). The bike trainer gives me the ability to get my heart rate up and get a cardio workout in to supplement my lifting.</p>\n<h2>Improving My Development Chops</h2>\n<p>I can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s been a lot to say here. I&#x27;m learning a lot at my new job and am continuing on with my fitness tracker project, so I&#x27;m going to count that as a continued success.</p>\n<h2>Reading More</h2>\n<p>Again, not much to say here, I&#x27;m on my fourth book of the year. Haven&#x27;t always felt like reading books every night, but I have done a better job at keeping up with my RSS feeds.</p>\n<h2>Wrtiting More</h2>\n<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve done a little better with this. Two months in, I have almost half the number of posts I had in 2020. I think I&#x27;ll be able to keep this up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>All in all, there&#x27;s not much to report. I&#x27;m just gonna keep doing my thing and hoping that I will be eligible for the COVID vaccine sooner than I figure.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

None of them are particularly huge, but I like the end result.</p>\n<h2>Adjusted the Header</h2>\n<p>I decided to change up the header a little bit. The header isn&#x27;t horribly different from before, but now I decided to make it span the full width of the browser window. I also added a link to the RSS feed since I feel that&#x27;s an important feature in today&#x27;s web. It might have fallen out of favor in some circles, but I still love it. I also moved the light/dark mode switcher from the footer to the header and made it a little more descriptive with a sun and moon icon.</p>\n<h2>Adjusted the Footer</h2>\n<p>I also decided to adjust the footer, re-laying out the links and allowing it to fill the full browser window.</p>\n<h2>Removed SASS</h2>\n<p>SASS came pre-bundled with Jekyll so when I built the original version of my blog, it made sense to just go with it. Since then, CSS has gotten official variable support as well as a whole bunch of other nice features, so I decided to swap it out with plain old CSS. The conversion wasn&#x27;t too bad and I feel like I was able to clean up the CSS some in the process, particularly with the light and dark mode.</p>\n<p>CSS variables just make applying a light/dark theme so simple</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>:root {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --font-family: &#x27;Maven Pro&#x27;, &#x27;Segoe UI&#x27;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --background: #ededed;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --background-image: url(&#x27;/assets/images/background.png&#x27;);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --font-color: #444444;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --blue-medium: rgb(6, 44, 156);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --blue: hsl(215.9, 100%, 40%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --box-shadow: 0 12px 24px 0 hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 40%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --review-border-color: var(--blue);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --svg-display-lightmode: inline;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    --svg-display-darkmode: none;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    :root {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --background: hsl(0, 0%, 13.3%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --background-image: none;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --font-color: hsl(0, 0%, 93.7%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --blue-medium: hsl(209.1, 78.5%, 43.7%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --blue: hsl(199, 98.3%, 45.9%);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --review-border-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --svg-display-lightmode: none;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        --svg-display-darkmode: inline;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    }</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>}</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<h2>Changed the Light/Dark Mode Toggle</h2>\n<p>Besides the switch itself, I also changed how I handle overriding the system&#x27;s theme. The CSS variables definitely helped with this, although I have an item on my to-do list to see if I can&#x27;t improve this a little more. If you&#x27;re a user who overrides your system theme, there might be a momentary flash of the system theme before your override takes effect. It&#x27;s still an option though so I feel like that&#x27;s a plus.</p>\n<h2>Started Working with SVGs</h2>\n<p>SVGs were something that I only recently started looking at. I decided to go with SVGs for both the theme switch and the RSS icon at the top. Learning <a href=\"https://inkscape.org/\">Inkscape</a> as well as how to integrate it into the page was a fun challenge.</p>\n<h2>My &#x27;Likes&#x27; Page</h2>\n<p>I used to run weekly posts with links I&#x27;ve liked. I&#x27;ve decided to take a page from <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/\">Dave Rupert</a> and simply add a page that lists recent articles, podcasts, or anything else that catches my eye. I liked his idea of using his Feedbin starred feed, but felt like I might as well make it manually as I find things elsewhere that I&#x27;d want to include. You can veiw this on my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/likes\">Likes page</a>.</p>\n<h2>Updated Bookshelf &amp; Movies</h2>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/bookshelf\">reading list &amp; bookshelf</a>, as well as my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/movies\">movies</a> used very similar code to render. I opted to condense the JS that handles them as well as the CSS to make the pages easier to manage. I also ended up shrinking the images and expanding the width some to allow more content to be viewed at once.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I generally like how my blog looks so I didn&#x27;t go hog-wild, but it was nice to &quot;freshen&quot; it up a bit. I have a few more things I&#x27;m thinking of doing, but let me know what you think so far.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I have been using <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/01/21/tracking-my-fitness-journey.html\">spreadsheets to track a lot of my fitness goals</a>. This approach generally works, but I thought it would be easier if I had an app for that. So I did what any self-respecting fitness enthusiast developer would do...make one myself! But with that, also come unit tests.</p>\n<p>There are a whole bunch of options out there to track this stuff, but not all of them do everything, and they don&#x27;t do what I think works for me. I also figured that I&#x27;m a developer and I could build myself something that works for what I&#x27;m looking for. I was also itching to try out Typescript &amp; React, as well as the .NET Core Web API.</p>\n<p>Not to get too in the weeds, but with this project, I wanted to do unit testing as I develop rather than at the end like I did with Digital Family Cookbook. The one thing I realized that I needed to do was be able to mock the API calls on the frontend. I stumbled upon a great post by Kent C. Dodds talking about how we <a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch\">shouldn&#x27;t be mocking window.fetch</a>. In it, he talks about <a href=\"https://github.com/mswjs/msw\">MSW</a>, short for Mock Service Worker and how we can use that to intercept and mock our data calls.</p>\n<p>I decided to give it a try and I have to say that I&#x27;m seriously impressed with how easy it is to setup and use. I figured I&#x27;d spend a little bit of time here going through how to quickly set it up and how to use it.</p>\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>$ npm install msw --save-dev</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>or</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>$ yarn add msw --dev</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>I have a folder in my <strong><code>/src</code></strong> directory called <strong><code>test</code></strong> that holds my basic testing configuration. You can put these files in a different directory if you have your project laid out differently, but the handlers and the server setup are how your fetch calls get handled for your unit tests.</p>\n<h3>Create Your Handlers</h3>\n<p>MSW works by having a list of handlers that handle the various different fetch calls. You specify the endpoint and when window.fetch calls the endpoint, instead of interacting with your API, it interacts with the mock server.</p>\n<h4><code>/src/test/server-handlers.ts</code></h4>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { rest } from &#x27;msw&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const handlers = [</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    // retrieve a user by their ID</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    rest.get(&#x27;*/users/getuserbyid&#x27;, (req, res, ctx) =&gt;

This is where you specify how each endpoint will respond to the API call.</p>\n<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the first handler where I&#x27;m getting a user by their ID. My React component might need to handle a situation where the user being looked up doesn&#x27;t exist. In this case, I can add some logic in the handler to return an error in this case when the ID is less than zero. That way I can test how the component handles an unknown user by passing in a negative number (or zero), while returning the user&#x27;s info for other requests.</p>\n<p>Not all handlers need to be as complex. If you look at the second item where I&#x27;m saving a user, you&#x27;ll see that I don&#x27;t have any logic around the request, I just send back a success message. Depending on what you&#x27;re testing, you might not need to do any additional handling of requests and responses.</p>\n<p>Just make sure to add a handler for every fetch call.</p>\n<h3>Setup Your Server</h3>\n<h4><code>/src/test/server.ts</code></h4>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { setupServer } from &#x27;msw/node&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { handlers } from &#x27;./server-handlers&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>// create the server object by passing in your handlers</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const server = setupServer(...handlers);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>export { server };</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This code sets up your server by passing in the handlers you created above and passing them as an argument to the setupServer object from MSW.</p>\n<h3>Setup Your Tests</h3>\n<h4><code>/src/setupTests.ts</code></h4>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>import { server } from &#x27;./test/server&#x27;;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>beforeAll(() =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    // start up the server</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    server.listen({</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        onUnhandledRequest(req) {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            console.error(&#x27;Found an unhandled %s request to %s&#x27;, req.method, req.url.href);</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    });</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>});</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>afterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers());</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>afterAll(() =&gt; server.close());</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>This code imports your mock server and tells it to start listening before running any tests, and then resets the handlers and closes the mock server when testing is complete.</p>\n<p>When starting the server in the <strong><code>beforeAll</code></strong> function, I like to pass in the <strong><code>onUnhandledRequest</code></strong> argument. I sometimes forget about calls to the API when writing the tests, so if a window.fetch call is made that I don&#x27;t handle, it will output an error message to the console letting me know what call was made so I can go back in and handle it. It&#x27;s not necessary, but I&#x27;ve found it useful now and again.</p>\n<h3>Telling Jest About MSW</h3>\n<h4><code>/jest.config.js</code></h4>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>module.exports = {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    setupFilesAfterEnv: [&#x27;./src/setupTests.ts&#x27;],</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>};</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>Jest needs to know that MSW exists so that it can start the listener. In the setupFilesAfterEnv array, make sure to add the <strong><code>/src/setupTests.ts</code></strong> file.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>This is basically all there is to the setup. Anytime your frontend makes a fetch call, instead of going to the actual endpoint, it will instead go to your mock server. For me this makes this portion of testing easy as I can worry about unit-testing the API separately and focus primarily on the components and frontend. MSW makes configuring the handlers is simple and easy while still providing you the ability to handle edge case and error logic as needed. I would highly recommend giving it a try.</p>\n<h2>One Last Thought</h2>\n<p>One other cool thing about MSW is that you can also use it for development as well as testing. I can&#x27;t really attest to it as I don&#x27;t use it for this use case, but MSW allows you to setup a service worker to handle your requests as you develop. If you don&#x27;t have access to your backend locally or don&#x27;t want to play around with your database for whatever reason, you can <a href=\"https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/integrate/browser\">set it up</a> to play the backend for your development work as well.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Because of this, I decided I&#x27;d tweak my routine a little bit to help jumpstart some gains.</p>\n<p>Since I <a href=\"/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html\">built my home gym</a>, I&#x27;ve been running a 4 day version of a 5/3/1 plan mixed with the <a href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout\">PHUL</a> plan. This has generally worked out well for me. I was able to regain a decent chunk of the strength I lost. Now that I&#x27;m lifting around 6 days a week, I figured I&#x27;d add 2 more days worth of lifting to my cycle to hopefully help make more gains easier.</p>\n<p>I thought I&#x27;d share the routine I&#x27;ve built myself in hopes that maybe it&#x27;ll help inspire you or give you ideas on how to improve or build yours.</p>\n<h2>Some Terminology and Background</h2>\n<p>I base the weights of the 4 big lifts (Overhead Press, Bench Press, Squat &amp; Deadlift) off of what they call the &quot;Training Max&quot; or TM. This is basically 90% of your 1 rep max (1RM), which refers to the heaviest weight that you can do a single rep of the exercise. So when I say &quot;5 @ 75%&quot;, that means I am doing 5 reps at 75% of my Training Max. So if my TM is 100 lbs., I&#x27;d be doing 5 reps at 75 lbs.</p>\n<p>You&#x27;ll also notice for Mondays through Thursdays, I start with the big lift 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, &amp; 1+ @ 95%. That final &#x27;1+&#x27; set is the key set. That&#x27;s what determines when I increase my TM. If I can do at least 5 reps at 95% of my TM, then I bump up my TM by 5 lbs. Some people only use 3 as the cutoff, but I prefer 5...it&#x27;s a personal choice.</p>\n<p>The other notations should be self explanatory. &quot;3 x 8-12&quot; means 3 sets of 8-12 reps.</p>\n<h2>The Routine</h2>\n<h3>Mondays - Overhead Press</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Overhead Press</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li>\n<li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li>\n<li><strong>Barbell Row</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Front Dumbbell Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>Barbell Shrug</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>EZ Bar Curl</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Skullcrusher</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Twenty-Ones</strong>: 1 x Narrow Grip, 1 x Wide Grip, 1 x Reverse Grip</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Tuesdays - Deadlift</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deadlift</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li>\n<li><strong>Squat</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li>\n<li><strong>Romanian Deadlift</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Standing Calf Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>Russian Twist</strong>: 4 x 15-20</li>\n<li><strong>Ab Wheel</strong>: 4 x 10+</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Wednesdays - Bench Press</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li>\n<li><strong>Overhead Press</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li>\n<li><strong>Dumbbell Row</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>Dumbbell Bench Press</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>Hammer Curl</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Dumbbell Fly</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Overhead Tricep EZ Bar Extension</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Twenty-Ones</strong>: 1 x Narrow Grip, 1 x Wide Grip, 1 x Reverse Grip</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Thursdays - Squat</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Squat</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li>\n<li><strong>Deadlift</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li>\n<li><strong>Front Squat</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Seated Calf Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>Dumbbell Side Bends</strong>: 4 x 15-20</li>\n<li><strong>Ab Wheel</strong>: 4 x 10+</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Fridays - Upper Body</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: 4 x 6 @ 75%</li>\n<li><strong>Overhead Dumbbell Press</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Close-Grip Bench Press</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Upright Row</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Zottman Curl</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Dumbbell Tricep Extension</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Timed Farmer Carries</strong>: 3x</li>\n<li><strong>Twenty-Ones</strong>: 1 x Narrow Grip, 1 x Wide Grip, 1 x Reverse Grip</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Saturdays - Lower Body</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Squat</strong>: 4 x 6 @ 75%</li>\n<li><strong>Sumo Deadlift</strong>: 4 x 6 @ 75%</li>\n<li><strong>Bulgarian Split Squat</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Hip Thrust</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li>\n<li><strong>Seated Calf Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>Russian Twist</strong>: 4 x 15-20</li>\n<li><strong>Ab Wheel</strong>: 4 x 10+</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Edit (2/1/21 7:13pm): Typos</em></p>\n            </div>\n        ",

            "content_html": "\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>As I&#x27;m sure just about all are aware, yesterday January 6, 2021, A group of Trump supporters stormed and broke into the US Capitol Building. I followed what was going on and it left me angry, upset, and utterly speechless.</p>\n<p>Seeing everything happen and stewing on it 24 hours later, I&#x27;m still angry. In fact I&#x27;m beyond angry. This is probably going to be a little rambly and might not be as coherent as I would prefer, but the emotions are just so raw.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m angry that we currently have a Commander-in-Chief who has spent the last 4+ years sowing division in this country. I&#x27;m angry that he continually spouts his lies and attacks without any real pushback from the GOP. Make no mistake...the entire GOP is complicit in this. The evidence of how awful a man Trump is has been out there in the open for well beyond his Presidency. The vicious attacks he&#x27;s made from the campaign trail, and then the White House were plain as day. He&#x27;s been egging on his supporters and inciting violence since he began his campaign. Remember how he was offering to pay the legal fees of anyone who wanted to assault protestors at his rallies? Violence against his &quot;enemies&quot; is his thing. Anyone who is shocked or surprised by this has not been paying attention.</p>\n<p>That any members of the Republican Party only now are coming out with any kind of force against him is what I would call &quot;too little, too late&quot;. Hell, less than 24 hours after the attack, you still had well over 100 GOP Senators and Representatives pushing to overturn an election that Joe Biden won freely and fairly. An election where the GOP actually did pretty well down ballot mind you. I wish I could understand their logic, especially those who were elected using the same ballots as Biden, the same voting technology as Biden, counted by the same election officials as Biden, and yet consider their election victory legitimate but Biden&#x27;s not. I mean I know <em>WHY</em> they&#x27;re doing it. They know there&#x27;s no voter fraud, that Joe Biden won fairly. They just have to bow down and lick the boots of their wannabe dictator-god. That Ted Cruz would use the thought that people believe the election was stolen as any kind of reasoning to object to the result is maddening. Reject the lies and disinformation being spread. Tell people the truth. Losing sucks and no one would blame anyone for being upset their side lost. It was disheartening for me in 2016 when Trump won. That didn&#x27;t mean that I raged and attacked D.C. That Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley would come out and criticize the protestors makes things even worse as both of them were primary causes of the violence.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m angry at every single person who voted for Trump. They&#x27;re partly responsible as well. I&#x27;m sorry, I generally don&#x27;t like to group everyone into this, but all the signs were there in 2016 and again in 2020 at how awful of a person Trump is and how completely unfit he is to hold such a position of power. They should take a long, hard look at themselves and think how they can support a President and a political party that has no problem throwing out an election or attacking its representatives if the result isn&#x27;t to their liking. Really think about it...the GOP is saying that if the result of an election doesn&#x27;t end with a GOP candidate winning, the election is rigged and illegitimate, and no amount of evidence to the contrary will change their mind.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m angry at the complete difference in reaction to this attack compared to the Black Lives Matter protests earlier in the year. The National Guard shot fucking rubber bullets and tear gas at peaceful protestors for a fucking photo op. This time, mostly white protestors break into the US Capitol Building, threaten the lives of our representatives and others, and what do the police do? They open the gates and take selfies with the insurrectionists. The difference? One group is Black, the other is white. I have no idea how anyone can look at this and NOT see the systemic racism that is going on. If this were the Black Lives Matter protest, there undoubtedly, and sadly would&#x27;ve been far more blood shed. At the end of the day 5 people so far, including 1 Capitol Police Officer lost their lives because Donald Trump is a sore loser and decided the best way to go forward was to incite his followers. He filled DC with gasoline and gunpowder, and handed them matches and lighters.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We‚Äôre not asking you to shoot them like you shoot us, we‚Äôre asking you to NOT shoot us like you don‚Äôt shoot them...</p>‚Äî Davontae Harris (@wichkid) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wichkid/status/1346990204071108610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<p>I think the thing that saddens me the most is that I really thought our institutions would hold up better. That the institutions we&#x27;ve fought for and built up over the last almost 250 years would dull the worst of Trump. Instead they just caved. The Attorney General had no problem acting as Trump&#x27;s &quot;personal&quot; lawyer despite his responsibility to be the country&#x27;s lawyer. I thought the systems of checks and balances would help. Instead, they were just rolled over.</p>\n<p>Trump used his office to move forward one thing. Himself. Nothing else has ever mattered to him. If there&#x27;s nothing in it for him, he&#x27;s not interested. And sadly, that won&#x27;t go away even when he leaves the White House on January 20. Trumpism is here to stay. Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, and the rest of the GOP will make sure of that.</p>\n<p>All we can do is keep fighting to make the ideals of America win again. The country has never been perfect, there has always been ways for it to improve. We must keep fighting.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

And yet, the year has now come to a close.</p>\n<p>If I had to come up with one <em>polite</em> word to use for 2020, it would probably be <strong>Trainwreck</strong>. I feel like that describes this year so perfectly. The year came to an abrupt &quot;oh shit&quot; moment in mid-March when COVID-19 spread across the world like nothing we&#x27;ve seen before. In the late spring and early summer we <em><strong>again</strong></em> faced the reality of social unrest after more murders of black men and women at the hand of the police. And to top it all off, in the fall we dealt with an election like no other took place between a raging, narcissistic, wannabe dictator and a capable, qualified candidate. One wouldn&#x27;t be blamed at all for forgetting that a lot of other things took place throughout the year.</p>\n<p>But I think at this point, I&#x27;ll look a little closer to home.</p>\n<h2>What My Year Looked Like</h2>\n<p>First, I want to say that I am grateful for everything I have. As much as 2020 has sucked, the one thing that it has done is make me realize how much I have. I have a wonderful wife who I love more than anything. Without her, I don&#x27;t know how I could&#x27;ve made it through some of the darker days of the year. I have my health and a job that allows me to work from home. I know others aren&#x27;t nearly as fortunate.</p>\n<p>My year started out like any other. I had set up 4 basic goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Diet (the one we&#x27;re all always working on)</strong>: You&#x27;d think that this one wouldn&#x27;t be too bad given that I cooked at home a lot more... Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the case...being home made it a little too easy to snack on things. Oh well. Given the lousy year, I&#x27;m not all that upset about it. I managed to do a lot of other things in my fitness realm. I <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html\">built a home gym</a> I ended up <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/12/16/reflections-on-my-running-streak-coming-to-an-end.html\">running 175 days in a row</a> and I topped 800 miles running for the year. Not perfect, but I&#x27;m mostly content with what I was able to do fitness-wise all things considered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Finish Digital Family Cookbook</strong>: I got so close on this one. For the moment it&#x27;s code-complete, but I suspect that there&#x27;s more I need to do to clean it up. I also need to figure out how to package it. Like many side projects, I got side-tracked by other, more-shiny things. I decided I needed to brush up on my .NET skills and learn what .NET Core is all about so I ended up using it to <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/07/05/so-i-finally-finished-a-side-project.html\">rebuild Where Do You Want to Eat</a>. I ended up having to take it down due to hosting costs (I think I&#x27;ve found a more cost-effective alternative), but I can happily say I finished it. I also started a new side project to replace <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/01/21/tracking-my-fitness-journey.html\">many of the spreadsheets I use to track my fitness</a>. It&#x27;s relatively early on in development, but I&#x27;m using it as a learning project for building a .NET Core Web API and for teaching myself TypeScript. It&#x27;s no wonder Digital Family Cookbook is sitting idle...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Read More</strong>: This one I can say I was able to do. As my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/reading-list/\">reading list</a> shows, I was able to read quite a bit more this year compared to last. My reading mixed both fiction and nonfiction well. As much as I like learning when I read, sometimes it&#x27;s nice to leave the world of reality into a good story.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Write More</strong>: This one was mixed. I feel like I wrote more posts, but don&#x27;t really know. Given everything that went on during the year, sometimes it was just hard to concentrate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Things</h3>\n<p>One other thing I ended up doing this year was <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/12/14/starting-a-new-job.html\">choosing to leave my job for a new opportunity</a>. I&#x27;m only a month in, but am happy with where my career is heading.</p>\n<h2>Looking Forward and Hoping 2021 is Better</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;m not going to be naive and think that 2021 is going to get rid of all the ills of 2020. The Coronavirus is not going to go away January 1st even with the vaccine now being administered. Joe Biden getting inaugurated January 20th isn&#x27;t going to magically get rid of Trumpism. Fixing racial justice and correcting the structural racism in the world is not going to happen overnight. All of this will take time and effort on the part of everyone. 2020 just seemed to amplify everything.</p>\n<p>What I can do, is try to change my mindset and make 2021 feel like a better year.</p>\n<p>For 2021, I&#x27;m not going to really set any specific goals...more just things I want to work on.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Staying Active</strong>: I&#x27;d like to say 2021 will be the year I fix my diet, but I think we all know where that is heading... Instead, I&#x27;m going to focus on continuing to stay active. I&#x27;m going to continue to lift, run, walk &amp; bike. I&#x27;m going to try to cut down on the snacking, but the focus will be on getting stronger and moving more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improving my Development Knowledge</strong>: My work with Digital Family Cookbook, Where Do You Want to Eat 2, and now my fitness tracking side project have all helped with this. I&#x27;m going to continue working on my side projects to help improve my capabilities. I know it&#x27;s only been 1 month at my new job, but I already sense my abilities being pushed (which is a good thing) to help myself grow. I&#x27;m also hoping to publish Digital Family Cookbook, but I&#x27;m sensing I might rebuild it using .NET Core once my fitness tracker is complete...we shall see...I could find a new shiny-thing by then. The important thing to me is continuing to learn and grow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Continuing to Read</strong>: I don&#x27;t think much more needs to be said here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Write More</strong>: I say I&#x27;m going to do this every year. I have a list of topics I want to write about, but never seem to. I think I&#x27;m going to try to get over my &quot;impostor syndrome&quot; and start to write more. I say impostor syndrome because in some of the cases, I feel like part of my reluctance to write, is making myself sound stupid. I&#x27;m going to try to push that fear aside and write more, and use any mistakes I happen to make a way to learn and grow.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think I&#x27;ll finish up there. This is what I&#x27;m hoping to work on in 2021.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have experienced loss and suffering this year, I hope 2021 and the future in general is better for you.</p>\n<p>Here&#x27;s to a better 2021.

This left me with limited options for fitness (or at least options that appealed to me). Running had generally been my go-to cardio activity since I started becoming more active, so I started running, a lot. I started running 3-4 miles a day, 4-5 days a week. I hated sitting still, so it was a good way to get my blood flowing. I stayed away from parks and just ran around my neighborhood. Didn&#x27;t need a mask as I could just switch sides of the street those few times I ran into someone.</p>\n<p>I missed the second half of April thanks to pain in my hip, but was able to get going again in May. Towards the end of June (June 22nd to be exact), I ended up starting my running streak. I didn&#x27;t actually even mean to start it. I just started running every day, and soon enough I realized that I had been able to keep it going. It reached a month, then two, and I was able to just keep going. Even after I <a href=\"/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html\">built my gym</a>, I still made a point to go for a run after lifting...which became extra painful on some legs days. My only rule was that I had to hit the 1 mile mark for it to count. Anyone who wants to start a running streak can set the boundaries for their streaks, but for mine, I felt like 1 mile was a good mark to hit.</p>\n<p>There were plenty of days where I didn&#x27;t want to run. Days where I just wanted to be lazy and play video games all day or anything else. But I persevered and went for a run anyway. There were days where my neighbors probably thought I was nuts running in the pouring rain (those were not fun runs). There were other days where I ran in 90+ degree weather...they weren&#x27;t fun either, though I tried sticking to morning runs during the hottest days of summer to make it a little easier on myself. I was proud of myself. I managed to hit 100 days, then 150, never seeming to slow down.</p>\n<p>What finally did me in was a low to mid 30s day when it was pouring rain. I hadn&#x27;t been enjoying running with the temperature in the 30s to begin with, and the pouring rain certainly didn&#x27;t encourage me either. Not to make excuses for myself, but I kinda knew this day was coming. Living in Pennsylvania, I knew that the weather was going to get cold. And while I could deal with cold, what that also brings is snow and ice (as I write this, it&#x27;s snowing out and we&#x27;re supposed to get as much as a foot of snow). I knew that once it started getting icy, my runs were going to stop. Why run if all I&#x27;m going to do is slip on the ice and break an ankle or leg? I&#x27;ll end up injured and won&#x27;t be able to do much of anything. I was hoping to get to 183 days, so I could say that I ran exactly half the year, but I&#x27;ll have to make do with 175 days. Still not too shabby!</p>\n<p>Looking back, I feel accomplished. It wasn&#x27;t always easy to force myself to run every day, but I still did it 175 days in a row. I think that&#x27;s the main takeaway from this for me. If you want something, stick with it. Work for it and don&#x27;t take the easy way out. It would&#x27;ve been easy for me to take a day off, say that it&#x27;s because I need a rest day and move on.</p>\n<p>As for now, I&#x27;m still working out. I&#x27;m still lifting weights in my basement gym, and I&#x27;ll still go for runs when the weather cooperates. I&#x27;ll probably even get my bike trainer out and get some indoor bike rides in. My running streak might be over, but my fitness activities sure aren&#x27;t!</p>\n<p>Here are the stats for my running streak:</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><p><strong>Days</strong>: 175</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><p><strong>Distance</strong>: 536.91 miles</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><p><strong>Average Distance Ran</strong>: 3.07 miles</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><p><strong>Time Running</strong>: 84 hours, 14 minutes, 33 seconds</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><p><strong>Average Pace</strong>: 9:25/mi.</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><p><strong>Running Shoes Gone Through</strong>: 1.25</p></div>\n            </div>\n        ",

It&#x27;s a common problem. You decide I&#x27;m going to go to the gym a few days a week, you stick with it for a week or two, then get lazy. I&#x27;ve dealt with this and have found a way to &quot;trick&quot; myself into sticking with my goals.</p>\n<h2>The So-Called Trick</h2>\n<p>For me, I have had plenty of days where I had to drag myself to the gym. The trick I use is I&#x27;ll go to the gym (nowadays my basement) and I&#x27;ll do my first exercise. If I do all my sets of that and still don&#x27;t feel like doing any more, then I&#x27;ll give myself the OK to pack up and go home. More often than not, by the time I finish the first lift, I&#x27;ll be in a better mood and will want to finish my workout in its entirety. There are of course still times here and there where I am just done after that first lift. But even then, at least I did something and won&#x27;t regret being lazy and skipping the workout.</p>\n<p>If lifting isn&#x27;t your thing, you can still apply this tactic elsewhere. With running for example, you could run around your block once and end early if you&#x27;re just not feeling it. You could also just commit to a short distance and increase if things get better.</p>\n<h2>The Journey Matters More than the Individual Day</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, the important thing is being able to stick to your goals. We all have our bad days, but they will be forgotten soon enough. Quitting the journey, or losing the momentum takes a bit more to come back from.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Even with the advent of the cell phone and smartphone, I&#x27;ve continued to wear a watch. In 2017, I purchased an Apple Watch Series 2 and have been happy with the purchase and the switch.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-11-01-apple-watch/applewatch.jpg\" alt=\"My Apple Watch\" width=\"1199\" height=\"898\"/></div>\n<h2>The History</h2>\n<p>I jumped on the fitness tracker with the original Fitbit Flex back in 2013. It tracked my steps and my sleep, but didn&#x27;t have a clock on it...just a few dots to indicate progress. Because of this, I ended up with 2 devices on my wrist: the Fitbit and my watch. It wasn&#x27;t super ideal, but it served its purpose.</p>\n<p>I had looked at the Apple Watch when Apple first released it, but found it a little lackluster for its price. The second generation Series 2 caused me to rethink things. The biggest addition for me was the built in GPS. The original Apple Watch could track runs and whatnot by GPS as well, but it required being tied to an iPhone. The series 2 allows you to track them independent of the iPhone. So if I don&#x27;t want to bring my iPhone with me, I don&#x27;t have to and I&#x27;ll still know how far I ran. I run a lot, so the ability to track my runs was incredibly important to me. I ended up pulling the trigger in January 2017 and entered the smart watch era.</p>\n<p>In 2020, while fixing my dishwasher with my Dad, I ended up cracking the screen on my Series 2 and ended up upgrading to the Series 5 which is what I&#x27;m currently using today.</p>\n<h2>What I Really Like</h2>\n<h3>Basic Info At a Glance</h3>\n<p>My watch face consists of some of the info I like to be able see at a glance. I can quickly view the weather, any events coming up, my fitness stats for the day, as well as easy access to starting a workout and my todo list. I can also easily customize this if I want to bring something else to the forefront. The weather &amp; rain are particularly useful to me right now since I&#x27;m currently on a run streak. On rainy days, it&#x27;s nice to be able to see quickly when I might be able to squeeze a run in.</p>\n<h3>Fitness Tracking</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of tracking my fitness. For me it helps motivate me to keep trying to improve. Running is the big thing I&#x27;ve always liked seeing data for. When I first started running with any kind of seriousness, I used the popular app <a href=\"https://runkeeper.com/cms/\">Runkeeper</a> on my phone. I moved to <a href=\"https://connect.garmin.com/\">Garmin</a> when I got my Garmin GPS watch and also used <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/\">Strava</a> both with Garmin and with my Apple Watch. After Strava got into some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases\">privacy trouble</a>, I decided to really try Apple&#x27;s built-in tracking. It was perfect for me and I ended up deleting my Strava account and sticking Apple&#x27;s app. The app works really well. It keeps track of my pace, distance, heart rate, gives me my mile splits, and keeps the activities private. There&#x27;s no easy way to share activities, but that&#x27;s fine by me...I don&#x27;t think anyone needs to see all that data anyway.</p>\n<h3>Quick Notifications</h3>\n<p>Assuming you&#x27;re careful with what notifications you want to see, being able to get them on your watch can be handy. I can have my phone in my pocket or somewhere around the house and still be able to check to see who messaged me or what task I&#x27;m being reminded to do.</p>\n<h3>Streaming Music</h3>\n<p>I use Spotify as my streaming music service, but I do have music stored on my iPhone from iTunes. The Apple Watch allows me to transfer some of those songs over to my watch which is nice for runs when I don&#x27;t want to carry my phone. I can connect my Bluetooth earbuds to my watch and off I go.</p>\n<h3>Changing Watch Bands</h3>\n<p>Okay, this one isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, but it&#x27;s nice that I can change my watch bands easily enough. People make jokes (rightfully so) about how expensive some of Apple&#x27;s bands can be, but the fact of the matter is that there are plenty of third parties who make some solid bands to fit anyone&#x27;s style. I tend to stick with the rubber bands since I use my watch for working out and it handles the sweat well, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to switch up the colors to fit my mood.</p>\n<h2>Cons</h2>\n<p>There are some cons to the Apple Watch to be aware of.</p>\n<h3>Battery</h3>\n<p>The battery on both my Series 2 and Series 5 have both been good. I can easily get through a day without having to worry about running out of juice. And since I don&#x27;t wear my watch to bed, it&#x27;s easy enough to charge it while I sleep. It does mean that whenever I go on any trips, it&#x27;s one extra charger I need to bring. And since the charger it uses is a variation of the wireless charging standard, you can&#x27;t even use a normal charging pad. (Apple really should <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21441290/apple-watch-qi-wireless-charging-standard-environment-cable-proprietary-standard\">make the switch</a>) This also means it&#x27;s not a good option if you need to go several days without ready access to power (think backpacking trip).</p>\n<h3>Expensive Screen Repair</h3>\n<p>The reason I upgraded to the Series 5 was cost-related. $250 to repair a cracked screen on a 3 year old watch when the latest model cost $400 didn&#x27;t seem like a good investment. The Series 2 was still running well, and having to see it go to waste over a screen crack was disappointing, especially from an environmental perspective. (I did give it to Apple for their recycling program)</p>\n<h3>Easy to Remain &quot;Too Connected&quot;</h3>\n<p>One of the things I&#x27;ve tried to keep tabs on is my screen time. All too often it&#x27;s easy to become distracted by my iPhone. The Apple Watch can amplify that if you let it. I attacked this problem by severely limiting what notifications I receive on my watch. Right now I think the only notifications I let go through to my watch are phone calls, iMessage messages, todo reminders &amp; calendar notifications. Limiting what the watch buzzes about helps tremendously.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Smart watches aren&#x27;t for everyone and they definitely aren&#x27;t always the most stylish of watches. For me though, I am glad to have it as it does exactly what I want it to.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

What I didn&#x27;t know was that this run would be the start of what would become a 2+ month running streak.</p>\n<p>Since March when everything shut down due to the Coronovirus pandemic, running became one of the only physical activities I felt comfortable doing. I was doing a pretty good job running 4-5 times per week and staying active which has definitely been important for keeping my spirits up. I have no idea what made me start this running streak, but five or so days into it, I decided to just keep it going to see how long I could go. My only rule was that a run had to be 1 mile for it to count. So far, this hasn&#x27;t been an issue, my shortest run was 1.28 miles which was the day after my first legs workout with my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html\">home gym</a> which killed my legs and made running quite a challenge for a few days while I was dealing with the DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness). On average, I&#x27;m hitting 3.12 miles per run, right around a 5k.</p>\n<p>Every week, I&#x27;ve been proud of myself for keeping it going. I&#x27;ve never taxed my legs like this, even when I was training for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon. Given that I&#x27;ve generally maxed out at 5, maybe 6 runs a week, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d handle the load. Today I hit 9 weeks and so far, my legs are holding up. Some days are better than others and I&#x27;ve limited my distance per run as to try to not overdo it. I ended up starting this at the end of June and given my distaste for the heat, I&#x27;m actually surprised I&#x27;ve been able to keep it up even with temperatures in the 90s. Early morning runs have certainly helped with the heat, but even in the morning, I come back drenched in sweat. I am also hoping the weather holds up. I&#x27;ve had to time some of my runs trying to avoid the rain. I don&#x27;t have access to a treadmill so if I want to run, it has to be outside. I&#x27;ve done a few runs while it&#x27;s been drizzling which haven&#x27;t been the most fun. Not sure I&#x27;m hardcore enough to run if it&#x27;s a downpour.</p>\n<p>Let&#x27;s see how far I can take this...I&#x27;m not planning on stopping anytime soon!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable going and it didn&#x27;t matter because LA Fitness closed their gyms anyway. My wife was even awesome enough to give me the OK to buy and build a home gym setup since she knew it was important to me. But back in March, I hesitated to spend the money on it since I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be cheap and I wasn&#x27;t sure how long this lock down would last. Foolish me, I thought we would be out of it in a month or two. I ended up switching to running over the last 4 months. I&#x27;ve logged more miles than I have in just about any year other than 2015 when I was training for my marathon. As I write this, I&#x27;m currently on a 44 day running streak after putting up over 100 miles in July. Suffice it to say, that&#x27;s kept me occupied.</p>\n<p>At the end of June however, LA Fitness notified me that they were planning on opening back up and would resume charging me my monthly rate. I still don&#x27;t feel comfortable going back to the gym so I looked into freezing or suspending my membership. Well that didn&#x27;t work as I expected and LA Fitness wanted to charge me $10 a month to &quot;suspend&quot; my membership. Basically I&#x27;d have to pay them $10 a month, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go to the gym either. That was a raw deal, so I opted to cancel my membership instead. After confirming that I was still able to make the purchases neccesary to build a home gym, I set out to price things out.</p>\n<p>I was hoping to buy things used to save some money, but the selection on Craigslist was minimal and the stuff that was there was the cheap stuff marked up 300+%. I kept an eye on Craigslist, but in the end I ended up buying everything new. The hardest part was finding what I needed and wanted in stock. It seems that I&#x27;m not the only person looking to build a home gym. Finding barbells, plates, and other equipment in stock was a challenge in an of itself. Thankfully I found the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym\">Home Gym Subreddit</a>. It has a regular In Stock Thread where users are awesome enough to announce when the various different shops have gear in stock. Sorting by new, I was able to find when barbells and plates came in stock on the various different shops. After about 2 weeks of scouring the web, I managed to purchase all the gear I needed.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m quite happy with what my setup. The only think I&#x27;ll need is a better mat for deadlifting. The flooring is a basic rubber mat from Amazon and won&#x27;t hold up to deadlifting 300+ lbs. I&#x27;ll definitely need to better protect the concrete floor of my basement.</p>\n<h2>My Setup</h2>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-08-04-so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym/homegym.jpg\" alt=\"My Home Gym Setup\" width=\"1140\" height=\"1920\"/></div>\n<p><strong>Rack</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/sml-1-rogue-70-monster-lite-squat-stand\">Rogue SML-1</a></p>\n<p><strong>Barbells</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.xmarkfitness.com/voodoo-commercial-7-olympic-bar/\">XMark Fitness Voodoo Bar</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-curl-bar\">Rogue Curl Bar</a></p>\n<p><strong>Bench</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-flat-utility-bench\">Rogue Flat Utility Bench</a></p>\n<p><strong>Plate Stand</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CAP-Barbell-Olympic-2-Inch-Plate/dp/B0013SZC8S\">CAP Barbell Plate Rack</a></p>\n<p><strong>Plates</strong>: Ironmaster &amp; York Plates</p>\n<h2>Tips for Building Your Own</h2>\n<p>Here are a few tips for building your own setup.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Plan</strong>: Determine your budget and what exercises you want to be able perform.

I called it ‚ÄúWhere Do You Want to Eat‚Äù It was simple. You typed in a zip code (the site did try to get your zip code using Google‚Äôs API), specified a range with optional keywords, and it randomly chose a restaurant. I ended up sunsetting it down after Google ended up changing how they charge for use of their API. I wasn‚Äôt mad of course, they let me use it for free for a while. It didn‚Äôt hurt that my little toy was hardly used. It also didn‚Äôt always provide the best results. The range was a radius, and you‚Äôd be surprised how close some places are that seem farther away. The final nail so to speak was that the results were hard to fine-tune. All too often restaurants were returned that didn‚Äôt seem to match the keywords as much as you‚Äôd want.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-07-05-so-i-finally-finished-a-side-project/where-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of the original Where Do You Want to Eat\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\"/></div>\n<p>In the end, it was a cool little project. It might not have turned into anything, but I learned a bit and that‚Äôs what matters.</p>\n<h2>From the Scrap Heap</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve been developing in .NET since I graduated from Drexel in 2007, but I realized earlier this year that I haven‚Äôt really explored everything going on in .NET Core. Over the course of the year, especially during this pandemic, I‚Äôve been catching up on what‚Äôs been introduced in .NET Core.</p>\n<p>I decided to use this time to bring back <em>Where Do You Want to Eat</em> but with a slightly different premise. Instead of relying on a geolocation API, I decided that I would build it to support user accounts where the users would enter in all the restaurants themselves. I figured it would improve the results if users put in their own restaurants. Restaurant discovery would take a hit as it could never return a restaurant not in your list, but I felt like that was a reasonable tradeoff. I‚Äôd also let the user assign tags to each restaurant so that during the random selection, they could narrow down the results a little (like if they knew they weren‚Äôt in the mood for say Sushi).</p>\n<h2>The Technology</h2>\n<p>I decided to use ASP.NET Core MVC as the base technology. I had used ASP.NET MVC in previous jobs and projects, and it seemed the best foundation to start for this project. For the data modeling side of things, I used Microsoft‚Äôs Entity Framework which made setting up the data layer a breeze. The template that comes with .NET Core 3.1 also included Bootstrap for the UI framework so I decided to stick with that. It did make building the UI easy by having the CSS formatting all set up, which I suppose is the point.</p>\n<p>The final thing I did was get myself familiar with the .NET Unit Testing tools. Despite all my experience in the .NET Framework, I‚Äôve never done any unit testing. My first foray into unit testing was with <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/2020/05/06/delving-into-unit-testing.html\">Jest and the React Testing Library for another side project</a>. I ended up using <a href=\"https://xunit.net/\">xUnit</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/moq/moq4\">Moq</a> to do the heavy lifting. I had to get my head around how they handled the mock data, but once I got that down, setting up the tests were pretty easy. The experience I had in the Node.js and React world definitely came in handy to know what I wanted to test and how to go about laying the tests themselves out.</p>\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n<p>From the start, I knew I wanted to use Microsoft Azure for hosting. I used Amazon Web Services for most of my projects, but decided I‚Äôd give Azure at try to see how easy it is to use. Since I built the site in .NET Core, it only made sense. I managed to get it up and running relatively easily thanks to several tutorials I found online. I‚Äôm a little concerned on the cost factor, so I‚Äôm going to have to see after a month or two what it costs me and if I‚Äôm going to have to find a different hosting platform. I‚Äôm not really sure how to monetize it outside of ads, and depending on the cost, I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd generate enough to compensate. I don‚Äôt mind paying to host it of course, and I‚Äôm hoping it won‚Äôt end up costing too much since it‚Äôs probably not going to get a lot of usage and won‚Äôt need a lot of data processing. If the costs are too high, I‚Äôll have to look into some alternatives.</p>\n<p>I found that it was a fun little project to build, and a good learning experience. I do find it kind of odd to release it during a pandemic where we probably shouldn‚Äôt be going out to eat, but for now it can still be used for takeout. So please feel free to check it out, test it out, and let me know what you think!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I do however know that Section 230 serves as the underpinning of how the current Internet works and why all the sites that we all love can survive and exist.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For even better coverage of Section 230, I‚Äôd highly recommend you follow <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com\">Techdirt</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmasnick\">Mike Masnick</a> on Twitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The biggest thing Section 230 provides is protection for website owners from content their users post. It means that when a user posts a Tweet or someone posts on Facebook, Twitter and Facebook aren‚Äôt held legally responsible should user post libel or anything else that might open them up for legal repercussions. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine how many issues website owners would have without this protection...especially smaller sites with comment sections. It also gives them the protections to moderate their sites however they choose without having to worry about it affecting their protection.</p>\n<p>Now we can certainly debate <em>HOW</em> sites like Twitter or Facebook moderate their users, but that doesn‚Äôt change how important Section 230 is for today‚Äôs internet. Think about YouTube. YouTube has hundreds of hours of video uploaded by users per minute. There is absolutely no way that they can check each and every video as they‚Äôre uploaded. They don‚Äôt have the manpower...no company does. Automation and A.I. might help some, but they often create many false positives or miss things altogether. Imagine if someone uploads an awful video and Google is responsible for the contents of the video even if it‚Äôs only online for a short period before they remove it. If they could be held liable for that, it would be disastrous. There&#x27;s no way they couldn‚Äôt take that risk. If companies as big and as resourceful as Google can‚Äôt do it, what hope do smaller site owners have?</p>\n<p>I write this now as <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200528/01321044592/two-things-to-understand-about-trumps-executive-order-social-media-1-distraction-2-legally-meaningless.shtml\">Donald Trump</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200617/13341644736/justice-department-releases-own-preposterous-recommendations-updating-section-230.shtml\">U.S. Department of Justice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200617/09243044732/senator-hawleys-section-230-reform-even-dumber-than-we-expected-would-launch-ton-vexatious-lawsuits.shtml\">Republican Senators</a> are trying to gut these protections. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200531/01363144611/joe-biden-wastes-huge-opportunity-to-support-free-speech-still-wants-to-revoke-section-230.shtml\">Joe Biden</a> isn‚Äôt much better as he‚Äôs no real fan of Section 230 either. This is all a mistake. Section 230 makes the Internet a much more diverse and better place. It‚Äôs ironic too, because while Trump is hating on Twitter now, he‚Äôs benefitting from Section 230. Without Section 230, Twitter would likely be driven to completely remove many of Trump‚Äôs Tweets...rather than just putting a violence or misleading tag.</p>\n<h2>Publisher vs. Platform (It Does Not Mean What You Think it Means)</h2>\n<p>One of the common arguments against sites like Facebook and Twitter is the false ‚Äúpublisher versus platform‚Äù distinction. This doesn‚Äôt mean what many seem to think it means. So many arguments I‚Äôve seen is ‚ÄúTwitter has to choose between being a publisher or being a platform...since they‚Äôre moderating, they‚Äôve chosen publisher!‚Äù (or something along those lines)</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs look at Twitter as en example. It‚Äôs generally considered a platform since they host other users‚Äô content. But it can also publish its own content like their blog and whatnot. Twitter is not responsible for its users&#x27; Tweets, but it <em>IS</em> responsible for content it posts itself. That‚Äôs essentially what the whole distinction is. It‚Äôs not really an either/or proposition.</p>\n<h2>The 1st Amendment Argument Against Social Media is Bullshit</h2>\n<p>There‚Äôs been a lot of complaints from those primarily in the GOP and on the right about social media being biased against conservatives. I personally find their claims dubious at best, but they seem to believe that sites like Twitter are responsible for holding up the standards of the 1st Amendment and Freedom of Speech. What they seem to forget, is that these sites are private companies. They are not the government, so the 1st Amendment does not apply to them. Social media sites have to determine how best to moderate their community. If they‚Äôre too open, they could drive away users who might be disgusted by questionable content. If they‚Äôre too strict, they could also drive away users as the majority of people do appreciate and want the ability to freely express themselves. But this is for the sites to decide, not the government.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Twitter, Facebook, and every other site have the ability to moderate their sites as they see fit. If users don‚Äôt like it, they can find a different community or start their own. The alternative is that the government regulates what users can post on social media which would likely abused by whichever political party is in power. I think we can all agree that would be bad.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-06-24-section-230-should-be-protected/xkcd_free_speech.png\" alt=\"xkcd: Free Speech Comic\" width=\"566\" height=\"577\"/><div class=\"RssPostImage_credit__RZiyy\"> Credit <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1357/\" title=\"xkcd: Free Speech Comic\"> xkcd</a></div></div>\n            </div>\n        ",

I knew what unit testing is and the general concepts behind it, but never got around to actually building or implementing any tests. I decided that for Digital Family Cookbook, that would change.</p>\n<p>I started my testing using <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/\">Enzyme</a> since that&#x27;s what Wes Bos used for his React/GraphQL tutorials that got me started. I got through a few tests, but never really gained the confidence that my tests were either useful or actually working. The biggest thing I had to wrap my head around was mocking the data and the calls to the backend. I struggled a bit trying to figure out how to best handle pulling and posting data. Needless to say, the struggle didn&#x27;t exactly help my desire to keep going.</p>\n<p>As luck would have it, I started following <a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com\">Kent Dodds</a> a while back on Twitter and stumbled into a few of his tweets talking about <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\">React Testing Library</a> and decided to look into it. After reading the documentation and going through some tutorials and Stack Overflow posts, I decided to ditch Enzyme and try it out to see if I would have any better luck. It turns out this was the breakthrough I was looking for. The other library I found thanks to some digging was the <a href=\"https://github.com/mike-gibson/mock-apollo-client\">Mock Apollo Client</a> which helped me understand and figure out how to handle mapping my mocked data for the tests.</p>\n<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of trial and error. I&#x27;ve had a lot of tests fail when I figured they should succeed. I&#x27;ve had some pass when I figured they would fail...and then investigated into why they succeeded. Through this, I was able to gain confidence that the tests are working, and doing what I expect them to do. I also know they&#x27;re working because when I intentionally &quot;break&quot; components, the tests quickly let me know. That&#x27;s another thing I&#x27;ve learned throughout all of this. Make your tests fail too so you can have the confidence that they&#x27;ll fail when you break something unintentionally.</p>\n<p>I ended up creating a list of components I wanted to test. I chose the components that made the most sense to make sure things continue to work. Components like logging in, signing up, the various CRUD calls to the database, etc. I&#x27;m now probably about halfway through adding the unit tests to Digital Family Cookbook. In retrospect, I should probably have done this as I went along. While I fully understand and appreciate the need for unit testing, compared to writing code and building new features, it&#x27;s rather boring. Spending all of this time writing and building the tests occasionally makes me want to just procrastinate and do something else. Had I written the tests as I went along, then the monotony might not have seemed as bad. I definitely will do that for my next project.</p>\n<p>In the end, I&#x27;m definitely glad I&#x27;m learning this. It will only help my development of Digital Family Cookbook and any future projects I work on. It also can&#x27;t help when it comes to my professional career.</p>\n<p>Here&#x27;s a list of articles, resources and other links that have helped me, so take a look, maybe they&#x27;ll help you too!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/\">Kent C.

I have in the past thrown everything out only to start over. I first built it in Ruby on Rails, but it was buggy and my limited knowledge of Rails made it a little hard to debug and figure out exactly what was wrong. I opted to rebuild it in PHP since I was quite familiar with PHP after building OpenVoter. I decided then that I wanted to start over to teach myself Node.js...well you get the idea.</p>\n<p>My latest go at it has been React with Node.js and GraphQL. This time, things are going better. I‚Äôm currently pretty far along with it and have some things to clean up, some bugs to fix, and unit tests to write.</p>\n<p>I mention the whole restarting the project because I‚Äôve spent the last week or two going through the code and converting everything from React class components to functional components and introducing React Hooks to the code. This has at times felt like I‚Äôve started over, though with a little less work.</p>\n<p>I use the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/\">Apollo</a> library in my project to handle the GraphQL queries for data. When I originally built the app, Hooks weren‚Äôt yet a thing and I ended up building everything using class components. Hooks were introduced, but I didn‚Äôt pay all that much attention to it as I wanted to finish the app and figured I could loop back later.</p>\n<p>That changed when I was trying to solve a GraphQL Mutation bug I was having and looking over the Apollo documentation. They changed their docs to focus on hooks and I was immediately drawn to how much cleaner the code looked. I decided to upgrade the version of React (and just about every other library) I was using and started to convert a few small components over to hooks to see how they worked. Well, let‚Äôs just say I was hooked (ok, that was a bad pun, sorry!).

I, like many others haven‚Äôt experienced anything like this before in my life. I‚Äôm not used to staying home all the time, not being able to really do anything outside of the home, not being able to go anywhere. It feels really weird to me.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been up to in an attempt to stay occupied.</p>\n<h3>Running</h3>\n<p>Since my gym closed, I‚Äôve been limited as to what I can do for fitness. I could do bodyweight exercises, but haven‚Äôt been in the mood. Running has been my go-to exercise. So much so that my monthly mileage for March was over 60 miles. I haven‚Äôt run this much since I was training for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon. I may regret it later, but between all this running and reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CMXZC7L\">The Incomplete Book of Running</a> by Peter Sagal, I‚Äôm actually considering signing up for the 2020 Philadelphia Marathon. I haven‚Äôt made the decision yet, but I‚Äôm giving it serious thought.</p>\n<h3>Puzzles</h3>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-03-31-quarantine-update/nyc-puzzle.jpg\" alt=\"Puzzle my wife and I completed of New York City\" width=\"962\" height=\"337\"/></div>\n<p>My wife and I have spent some evenings working on puzzles. This is the first one we did, a 750 piece panoramic shot of New York City (The sky was annoying!). We have since started a 2,000 piece puzzle of a scene from the Dolomites in Northern Italy.</p>\n<h3>Side Projects and Blog Improvements</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been spending some of my time improving my blog. I completely re-did my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/reading-list\">Reading List</a> and my <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/current\">Current</a> pages. I decided to make the books stand out a little more by adding the covers. I used CSS grid to make arrange them, and for the first time, used the HTML &lt;picture&gt; tag to try to make it a little quicker to load on mobile. It seems to be working.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve also spent some of the time working on my recipes site side project. I‚Äôve been teaching myself how to setup Unit Testing since it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never done. It‚Äôs been a little frustrating at times, but I‚Äôm getting there. I‚Äôve been using <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/\">React Apollo</a> to handle the GraphQL queries, and I‚Äôve been re-writing the components to use Hooks. It might delay its release, but after making the changes, I can see why people prefer hooks‚Ä¶the code looks so much cleaner.</p>\n<h3>Reading</h3>\n<p>So far since this has started, I‚Äôve been reading quite a bit. I ended up finishing 3 books so far, and last night I started on my 4th. I‚Äôve already increased my book count for 2020.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I hope you‚Äôre all staying safe out there.

Weight is obviously one of the metrics I track, but it‚Äôs not the only one.</p>\n<h2>Diet</h2>\n<p>Every day, I use MyFitnessPal to log what I eat and drink. I‚Äôve tried other services like LoseIt and Cronometer, but for all its issues, it works the best for me.</p>\n<p>Despite this, I still want to be able to keep track of things should MyFitnessPal become unusable for whatever reason or a better service comes along. To accomplish this, I copy the basic data into an Excel spreadsheet. I don‚Äôt go so crazy as to copy all the food I eat into the spreadsheet, but I input my calories, protein, fat &amp; carbs intake. This helps me see trends and see how I‚Äôm doing.</p>\n<p>I also grade myself daily for what I eat. I grade myself based on where I‚Äôm at with regards to my daily goals.</p>\n<h3>Calories</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 109% of my goal: 3 points</li>\n<li>110-119%: 2 points</li>\n<li>120% or more: 0 points</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Protein</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>90% or more: 3 points</li>\n<li>80-89%: 2 points</li>\n<li>&lt; 80%: 0 points</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Carbs &amp; Fat</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 109% of my goal: 2 points</li>\n<li>110-119%: 1 points</li>\n<li>120% or more: 0 points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I give myself a total of 10 points a day, weighted more on protein and calories. It might seem a little crazy, and it probably is, but I‚Äôve found that it helps keep me at least a little more honest with improving my diet. For quick looks, I code each day green, yellow, or red depending on points. 8 through 10 and it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù day, 5 through 7 is yellow, and below 5 is red.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-01-21-tracking-my-fitness-journey/diet-log.png\" alt=\"My Excel Spreadsheet Tracking My Diet\" width=\"1073\" height=\"764\"/></div>\n<p>It might be overkill, but I‚Äôm hoping it will help keep me on track. I‚Äôve generally been pretty good at keeping active, but the saying is certainly true:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anything I can do to help keep my diet in check will be of help as I think it‚Äôs the biggest obstacle left.</p>\n<h2>Lifting</h2>\n<p>If you‚Äôve read my blog before, you know that I‚Äôve been doing a lot of focus on strength training. With lifting, I feel the best way to make sure you‚Äôre progressing, is to make sure you‚Äôre tracking your lifts. At the gym, I use a moleskin notebook to keep track of my lifts. I used to use the Strong App, but tried paper and found I liked it better. I fill out my lifts for the cycle through and check off each set as I complete it. If I end up failing a set, I mark it with an ‚ÄôX‚Äô.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-01-21-tracking-my-fitness-journey/lifting-notebook.jpg\" alt=\"My Moleskine Notebook for Tracking My Lifts\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\"/></div>\n<p>When I get home, I transfer the data into a spreadsheet to calculate the volume lifted and to have an easier view back into my historical lifts.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-01-21-tracking-my-fitness-journey/lifting-log.png\" alt=\"My Excel Spreadsheet Tracking My Lifts\" width=\"1417\" height=\"781\"/></div>\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n<p>Every morning after I take care of the animals, I step on my scale and weigh myself. I then put it into, you guessed it, an Excel spreadsheet. Because our weight fluctuates daily, I have it automatically calculate rolling 3, 7, 14 &amp; 30 day averages. I mainly look at the 7 and 14 day averages to see how I‚Äôm doing. I almost never even bother looking at the daily numbers.</p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>The last couple years, I‚Äôve been trying to make it a goal for myself to generally be active almost every day. This doesn‚Äôt mean always running or the gym, although more often than not, that‚Äôs the likely activity. It could be as simple as a walk, or even some more extensive yard work.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-01-21-tracking-my-fitness-journey/activity-log.png\" alt=\"My Excel Spreadsheet Tracking My Activity\" width=\"1805\" height=\"431\"/></div>\n<p>I keep this saved in a spreadsheet as well as copies of some of the other data I log to give myself a dashboard to look at, as well as weekly averages. I also use colors to help get a quick sense of how things are going. I like seeing green as much as possible.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I‚Äôm probably over-complicating some things, but I like having data I can look at to see where I‚Äôm trending and potentially identifying where I can improve.</p>\n<p>So what about you? What do you track, and how?</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I really wish I knew where 2019 went because it seemed to have just flown by. It seemed like it was just yesterday that I was writing about 2018, looking onward to 2019. Now 2019 is gone, the new decade has <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2249/\">maybe?</a> begun, and I‚Äôm a year older.</p>\n<h2>First, Let‚Äôs Look Back to What I Wanted to Accomplish</h2>\n<p>Heading into 2019, I set several goals for myself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lose Weight</strong>: I had been struggling getting my diet under control for several years with a lot of progress and then relapses.</li>\n<li><strong>Read More</strong>: After reading like a fiend for several years, my reading had tapered off and I was hoping to read more.</li>\n<li><strong>Build My Side Project</strong>: I had plenty of false starts working on my new side project. Building part of it and then not liking where it was, etc. I wanted to actually finish it and teach myself Node.js, React, &amp; GraphQL in the process.</li>\n<li><strong>Write More</strong>: I‚Äôve been neglecting writing actual content for my blog and even had an idea for a novel. I wanted to write more for both.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What Went Well in 2019</h2>\n<h3>I was able to significantly progress in my strength training.</h3>\n<p>I went into 2019 setting strength goals of squatting 275 lbs., benching 225 lbs., deadlifting 400 lbs., and hitting 150 lbs. on the Overhead Press. I was able to hit each of these goals except for deadlift. In July, I switched to the <a href=\"https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/\">nSuns</a> lifting routine and was able to really increase my main lifts. I think part of it was psychological, realizing that I could actually lift the heavier weights. (As an aside, seeing the weight go up on squats was kind of scary to me prepping for the heavy sets.)</p>\n<p>I managed to get to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>300 lbs. on squats</li>\n<li>230 lbs. on bench press</li>\n<li>160 lbs. on overhead press</li>\n<li>345 lbs. on deadlift</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019/2019-strength-training-charts.png\" alt=\"Charts showing progress in squat, bench press, deadlift &amp; overhead press\" width=\"1245\" height=\"765\"/></div>\n<p>Not too shabby.</p>\n<p>I stalled out some on overhead press and bench press, but I‚Äôm slowly working my way back up. Better to go slowly and not hurt myself.</p>\n<h3>I made significant progress on my side project.</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Wes Bos‚Äô <a href=\"https://advancedreact.com/\">Advanced React tutorial</a>, I was able to gain a grasp on React &amp; GraphQL and make real progress on my side project currently called ‚ÄòDigital Family Cookbook‚Äô. The web app is mostly complete. I‚Äôm currently working on tidying some things up and unit testing. I haven‚Äôt really done something like this in a while so I‚Äôve been pretty excited seeing the progress.</p>\n<h3>I did manage to lose some weight.</h3>\n<p>I wasn‚Äôt able to completely fix my diet, but I did manage to lose 15 or so pounds. Could‚Äôve done better, but I did better than previous years.</p>\n<h3>I started playing goalie in hockey.</h3>\n<p>This wasn‚Äôt really a goal for me at the beginning of the year, but in September, I started playing goalie in ice hockey. I was able to borrow the gear from a fellow goalie in the lower league, tried it in some practice sessions, and decided I enjoyed it. I‚Äôve since purchased the gear and just finished my first season. I had some good games, but I also had some stinkers as well. Either way, I‚Äôve had a lot of fun playing the position and intend to continue playing goalie in the lower league and skate out in the upper league.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019/me-as-goalie.jpg\" alt=\"Me tending the net as a hockey goalie\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1200\"/></div>\n<h2>What I Struggled With in 2019</h2>\n<h3>I didn‚Äôt write nearly as much as I wanted.</h3>\n<p>Looking at my blog, it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to realize that I didn‚Äôt write all that much or add that much content. I had a bunch of weekly reading lists, but that‚Äôs not quite the same as pieces that have depth to them. I did start outlining an idea I‚Äôve had for a novel. The idea isn‚Äôt new, but I started to lay it out. But that‚Äôs about as far as I got. I ended up getting distracted with other things and let it go by the wayside.</p>\n<h3>I didn‚Äôt read that much.</h3>\n<p>Social media played a bit of a role in this one. I was trying to go to bed a little on the early side so I could read for a bit before bed. All too often though, I ended up pulling out my iPad instead of my Kindle. Part of it I might chalk up to some of the books I‚Äôve read and am currently reading. Some tended to be rather dense (good books, but just diving into their subjects deeply) and I wasn‚Äôt always in the mood to really focus. The book I‚Äôm currently reading, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062405667\">Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975</a> by Max Hastings is a fantastic look into Vietnam, but requires a lot of focus to keep up with what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs also almost 900 pages. I hope to finish by the end of the month.</p>\n<h3>I was a little too loose with my diet.</h3>\n<p>This one is pretty much everyone‚Äôs achilles heel it seems. I was no different. I went through stretches of being good and not over-indulging, only to follow it up with some less than disciplined days. I made progress, but not as much as I could have.</p>\n<h2>What I Hope to Accomplish in 2020</h2>\n<p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to change my goals for 2020. I‚Äôm going to stick with last year‚Äôs goals and do better.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Continue Working on My Diet</strong>: Not much more needs to be said here. The one thing I‚Äôm going to try to change though is to do better to record what I eat and drink in <a href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com\">MyFitnessPal</a>. I think some of the days I realized I was going to exceed my goals (not in a good way), I just stopped entering what I ate. Maybe by entering in more, I might be able to look at things in a different way and hopefully make some positive changes. I know I‚Äôm still going to have some days that might not be ideal for my diet, but screw it, I only live once and I‚Äôm not going to cut out all of the junk...just hopefully lessen the amount of times that happens.</li>\n<li><strong>Finish Up My Side Project</strong>: This one should hopefully not take too much longer. I hope to finish it, figure out the best way to deploy it, and share it with the world. I have a few other ideas for other projects as well, so who knows, maybe I‚Äôll end up building more in some of my free time.</li>\n<li><strong>Read More</strong>: My reading list has continued to grow, so I‚Äôm going to need to spend some time knocking out more of it. My plan is to cut back some on social media, Reddit especially. While I enjoy some good nonfiction, reading about history and whatnot, I‚Äôm thinking I might also lighten my reading a little bit and try to knock out some of the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù reads off my list. Hopefully that will make it easier to pick up a book rather than my iPad. I do plan on continuing to read my subscription to <em>The Economist</em>, but hopefully I can mix that in well enough.</li>\n<li><strong>Write More</strong>: This one is probably going to continue to be a little tougher for me, but I‚Äôm hoping I can set some time aside and put some focus into it. I think one thing that always scares me with blog posts, especially ones focusing on technical subjects is making a mistake and writing something that turns out being wrong (<a href=\"https://www.xkcd.com/386/\">Relevant xkcd</a>). If I can will myself past that and get used to correcting myself when I ‚Äúoops‚Äù, it should help me on my way. I‚Äôm hoping to make some progress both in writing more blog posts as well as maybe some work on my novel.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What Are Your Goals for 2020?</h2>\n<p>What are your goals for the new year?</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I‚Äôm making it as a content management system for cooking recipes. As I‚Äôve mentioned previously, I‚Äôm writing it using Node.js, React, &amp; GraphQL. It‚Äôs been quite a learning curve, but I‚Äôm definitely glad I‚Äôve been working on it. The tools are pretty cool and easy-ish to use once you get used to the syntax and some of the idiosyncrasies of React and JSX.</p>\n<h2>It‚Äôs different from what I‚Äôm used to</h2>\n<p>Most of what I‚Äôve written in the past has been Javascript interacting with a server running PHP or .NET, so I‚Äôm generally used to the way they work and run. I think the biggest thing that I‚Äôve had to remember is that Node is just javascript and it runs synchronously so I have to be cognizant of that. I‚Äôm generally used to my server code running asynchronously and not having to worry as much about race conditions. Getting data from a SQL server in let‚Äôs say .NET will run the query and not move on until the query is complete. With Node, I have to make sure I don‚Äôt move on before the data fetch is complete. In ES5, this generally meant callback hell. Thankfully with promises, combined with async/await in ES6, this has become a little easier to manage, but it did have me confused for a little bit not thinking.</p>\n<h3>The ‚ÄúGotcha‚Äù Moment</h3>\n<p>The perfect example of having to remember this difference was with what I‚Äôm currently working on. The feature I‚Äôm currently working on is the form to create recipes. I managed to get the form working, I got the data sent to the server, the recipe was created, but none of the directions or ingredients were attached to the recipe. I looked in the database and the directions were there, as were the ingredients, but the recipe had no idea they existed. I thought maybe the server wasn‚Äôt getting the data, but a console.log quickly showed me it was. What I failed to take into account was that the forEach function on the directions and ingredients array was not being awaited like I thought it was.</p>\n<p>I wrote the code to go through each ingredient and direction, add it to the database, and add its ID to an array. Then in the create recipe mutation, add the connections. Because it wasn‚Äôt being awaited, the arrays didn‚Äôt get populated by the time it was running the create recipe mutation so no link was ever created‚Ä¶oops!</p>\n<p>A quick change corrected that problem and all of a sudden, the form worked as expected.</p>\n<div class=\"ch-codeblock not-prose \"><div class=\"ch-code\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;white-space:pre;box-sizing:content-box;opacity:0;overflow:auto\"><code class=\"ch-code-scroll-parent\"><br/><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const directionCreations = formValues.directions.map(async (d) =&gt; {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    const direction = await ctx.db.mutation.createDirection(</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            data: {</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                direction: d.direction,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>                sortOrder: d.sortOrder,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>            },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        },</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>        ‚Äò{ id }‚Äô,</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    );</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>    return direction;</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>});</span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span></span></div></div><div><div style=\"display:inline-block;margin-left:16px\"><span>const directions = await Promise.all(directionCreations);</span></div></div><br/></code></div></div>\n<p>In the end, it was a pretty easy mistake to make, but it‚Äôs one I‚Äôm going to remember and learn from.</p>\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\n<p>I still have quite a bit of work to do on the project, but it‚Äôs nice to see some real progress on what I‚Äôm working on. I‚Äôm definitely enjoying the learning process and am excited to see some of my ideas come to life.

I had been running a variation of the <a href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout\">P.H.U.L. routine</a>, but decided I wanted to try something a little more intense since I felt like I was plateauing with both deadlifts and bench press.</p>\n<p>I ended up choosing the <a href=\"https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/#Progression_for_Main_Lifts\">nSuns 5 day routine</a> and so far, I‚Äôm really liking it. I haven‚Äôt gotten the chance yet to break through any of my plateaus as of yet, but I‚Äôm feeling stronger and putting up more volume than I have in a while.</p>\n<p>This week is going to be a big test for that. I just beat my previous personal record (PR) in squats by squatting 260 lbs. which is 10 lbs. heavier than my previous PR of 250. I managed to finally do a single plate (135 lbs.) overhead press last week and will be trying for 140 this week. The real test will be days 4 and 5 this week when I attempt to break my PRs for both deadlifts and bench press by going for 320 lbs. on deadlifts and 215 lbs. on bench. Both are 5 lbs. heavier than my previous records.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know how exactly to compare this to previous routines since I only do one set of each at the heaviest weight when before I would do sets of 3 to 5, but I‚Äôm feeling better about it.</p>\n<p>I also don‚Äôt know how much of this is just beginning the new routine and when I will inevitably stall a bit, but I‚Äôm taking it in stride. I feel like some of it is mental as well. As funny as it might sound, I feel like the routine is pushing me to exit my comfort zone and try heavier weights than I might normally attempt. This can of course be a little dangerous, but at the same time, it‚Äôs not doing it at such a steep jump to make it seem too impossible for me to do.</p>\n<p>The only real downside to it so far is that my gym sessions went from just over an hour to sometimes over an hour and a half. This isn‚Äôt much of an issue, but it has been limiting my available time to run and do other cardio. I‚Äôm still hoping to hit 300 miles running this year, but right now, I‚Äôm starting to lag a bit in reaching it. I‚Äôm hoping to go on some longer runs over the weekend once the temperature becomes a little cooler.</p>\n<p>All in all, I‚Äôm happy with my progress. My lifts are going up, my weight is coming down, and I feel better and healthier for it. I‚Äôm planning on keeping with this program for 12 weeks so I‚Äôll see what if any changes I‚Äôll make then.</p>\n<p>Until then, I‚Äôll keep on grindin‚Äô!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Workout Routine</a>.</p>\n<p>This is the first time I think I‚Äôve stuck with a routine that long without some tweaks here and there. I enjoyed the routine. It had me at the gym 4 days a week which gave me the other days to get some outdoor runs in. My gains haven‚Äôt been as fast as I have done in other programs, but I‚Äôm feeling stronger, and better about my progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Bench Press:</strong> 200 lbs. ‚Üí 210 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Squat:</strong> 230 lbs. ‚Üí 245 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadlift:</strong> 305 lbs. ‚Üí 315 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Overhead Press:</strong> 105 lbs. ‚Üí 115 lbs.</p>\n<p>Like I said, the progress hasn‚Äôt been as fast as I have done in other routines, but I‚Äôm also not doing linear progression like I was before. I generally have been sticking with the weight for 2-3 sessions, increasing the reps each week before bumping up the weight. While the weight numbers haven‚Äôt gone up, the volume lifted each week per exercise generally has. Even more important, I feel better about my lifts each time through the cycle. That said, I have struggled upping my bench press and deadlift weights, but I‚Äôm hoping to move up some soon.</p>\n<p>The only tweak I made early on was moving overhead press to my upper hypertrophy day. I was noticing that I was having problems with being able to bench heavy and OHP heavy the same day. Whichever one I did first I generally did well in, but whichever one came second, I struggled and often failed. I think this is also part of my troubles with deadlifts. I do deadlifts following my squats, and am wondering if that‚Äôs part of the reason.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm going to continue to do the P.H.U.L routine, but with some changes for the next 12 weeks. I‚Äôm going to move deadlifts to my lower hypertrophy day. I‚Äôm going to add Romanian Deadlifts to my lower power day in exchange, focusing more on volume than on weight. I‚Äôm also going to switch out barbell lunges for Bulgarian split squats. I‚Äôm hoping to continue to make progress, and see my lifts get heavier.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

In some areas I could be better, but overall, I‚Äôve been happy with what I‚Äôve done so far this year.</p>\n<h2>Losing Weight</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôm down almost 10 pounds, so I figure that‚Äôs progress. My diet still needs work, but I feel I‚Äôm doing better now than I was before. The color coding I‚Äôve done for myself still slants towards red and yellow more than green, but I think some of that comes from not enough protein and too many carbs rather than calories. Either way though, I can do better.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve continued to do well with making it to the gym. I decided to change up programs a little bit. I‚Äôve moved away from the PPL program and have adopted the <a href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout\">P.H.U.L.</a> program instead. My progression might end up getting a little slower, but hopefully I‚Äôll get stronger overall. I can happily say I‚Äôm benching more than 200 lbs. for the first time in my life. My squats and deadlifts are finally getting back up there after my groin injury so I‚Äôm hoping to continue making progress there.</p>\n<h2>Read More</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve fallen behind in this one a little bit with regards to books. I‚Äôm only on my third book of the year, but I have been reading the news and other sources as well. I need to continue to force myself to bed earlier to get in some reading before I turn off the lights.</p>\n<h2>Side Project</h2>\n<p>I can actually say that I‚Äôve made progress on this. I don‚Äôt have much to show at the moment, but I finished the <a href=\"https://advancedreact.com/\">Advanced React tutorial</a> I was working on and feel like I‚Äôm in a good place right now with it.</p>\n<h2>Write More</h2>\n<p>This one, I need to work on. I have a few ideas for posts, but need to find a good way to put them into words which is easier said than done. That said, I just need to sit down and do it.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm feeling good with where I‚Äôm at with my goals. There‚Äôs still plenty of year left, so hopefully I can make the most of it!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

The bad is that I could still be a little stricter on what I eat. I have more good days than bad, but there‚Äôs still quite a bit in the middle I could improve on. I‚Äôm not about ready to completely give up burgers and the ‚Äúless-than-healthy‚Äù options, but my self control to turn away the cookie, or slack off and order a pizza is a little higher than I would have preferred. I also haven‚Äôt been the greatest at sticking to a dry January, but I‚Äôm still drinking less than I normally do, so I‚Äôll count that as a win.</p>\n<p>In terms of my lifts at the gym, I finally crossed the 200 lbs. threshold on bench press, so I‚Äôm excited about that. Next bench press day, I‚Äôll be going for 205 lbs. for the first time ever. I‚Äôm currently doing 3 sets of 5 for deadlifts, so that‚Äôs stalled a bit at 295 lbs., but I generally feel like I‚Äôm getting stronger.</p>\n<h2>Reading More</h2>\n<p>I am about 2/3 through <em>The Forever War</em> by Dexter Filkins which would be my 2nd book of the year. I could read more I suppose, but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm on the right track.</p>\n<h2>Working on my Side Project</h2>\n<p>This one I‚Äôve made no progress on. I need to continue on with the tutorials. I really just need to set aside some time for it.</p>\n<h2>Writing More</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve tried over the last couple of weeks to come up with an idea for a post or something to write, but so far I‚Äôve been drawing blanks or have started something only to just delete it because I feel it‚Äôs not worth continuing for whatever reason. Again, I should probably just set aside some time and write, even if whatever it is I‚Äôm writing never sees the light of day.</p>\n<h2>Other Things I Have Been Doing</h2>\n<p>Some of the things that I have done in the meantime is start catching back up on my video game backlog. I finally played through Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and have started FarCry 5. The Lost Legacy definitely is worth playing. It continues the Uncharted series fantastic gameplay and story telling. FarCry 5 has been a lot of fun so far as well, but I‚Äôm not that far into it. I‚Äôm going to try to keep working and hope to knock out some more games.</p>\n<p>Moving on, I‚Äôm hoping to continue working towards my goals and hopefully make some progress on just about all of them. The first 3 weeks weren‚Äôt bad, but I think I can do better!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I did shed a few pounds over the course of the year, but nothing to really write home about. That said, I did make progress in my lifts. I ended up hitting 315 lbs. on deadlifts, 250 lbs. on squats, 195 lbs. on bench press, and 130 lbs. on overhead press. A torn tendon in my groin has set my squats and deadlifts back a bit, but I&#x27;m working my way back up. I do feel like I&#x27;m in better shape but I could have done better.</p>\n<h4>Reading More</h4>\n<p>I did better with reading than I did with my fitness goals. I ended out the year reading a total of 13 books. I probably could have done better, but as I mentioned, I subscribed to <em>The Economist</em> which occupied some of my reading time as well. I think my three favorite books this year were</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079VDR6HM\">The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States: A Speculative Novel</a> by Jeffrey Lewis</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1RRDMH\">Shooting Ghosts: A U.S. Marine, a Combat Photographer, and Their Journey Back from War</a> by TJ Brennan &amp; Finbarr O&#x27;Reilly</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VTV2899\">Vacationland</a> by John Hodgman.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Side Projects</h4>\n<p>My recipe project has taken a pause right now as I was starting to struggle figuring out the best way to move forward with it. I decided to buy Wes Bos&#x27; <a href=\"https://advancedreact.com/\">Advanced React &amp; GraphQL Course</a> in hopes of finding the best way to do things, and I have to say that it was just what I was looking for. I haven&#x27;t completed it yet, but it&#x27;s given me a lot more insight into React and something completely new with GraphQL. I&#x27;m hoping to finish it up soon and use what I&#x27;ve learned to build out my project.</p>\n<h4>Write More</h4>\n<p>This was a bust. Not much more can be said other than I just didn&#x27;t write nearly as much as I wanted.</p>\n<h2>Moving onto 2019</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;m going to stick with the same four goals for 2019.</p>\n<h3>Lose Weight</h3>\n<p>Over the last two months of 2018, I was very good at making sure to hit the gym almost daily. I&#x27;m going to continue to do that and move forward on my PPL (Pull, Push, Legs) routine. I&#x27;m also going to try to hold myself more accountable with my diet. I&#x27;ve created a spreadsheet to go along with my use of <a href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com\">MyFitnessPal</a> to help me with this. I&#x27;m color coding my calorie intake as well as my macros to help push me towards my goals. Three days in, and I already hate seeing numbers red. Fortunately most are green or yellow, but it&#x27;s a small sample size. I&#x27;m also going with a dry January. My alcohol intake isn&#x27;t excessive by any means, but I&#x27;m hoping that by kicking it out entirely, I can help shed some pounds in January and have the momentum carry over for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>With regards to fitness goals, I&#x27;m hoping to hit 400 lbs. on deadlifts, 275 lbs. on squats, 225 lbs. on bench press, and 150 lbs. on overhead press by the end of the year. I&#x27;d also like to hit the 300 mile mark running.</p>\n<h3>Read More</h3>\n<p>I&#x27;ve already finished one book this year (ok...ok...I started it in 2018), and I&#x27;m hoping to keep that going. I&#x27;m trying to mix the fiction in with the nonfiction to keep things interesting. My goal this year is 20-25 books, so hopefully I can reach that goal. I&#x27;ve done it before so I know it&#x27;s attainable.</p>\n<h3>Side Project</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I made some good progress with my recipe project, but my limited knowledge with React and Node started to limit me getting further. The <a href=\"https://advancedreact.com/\">Advanced React &amp; GraphQL Course</a> has been doing a great job helping me get my head around some of the more advanced areas, so once complete, I plan on moving forward. Hopefully, by the beginning of February I can get back to my project.</p>\n<h3>Write More</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest limiters I felt last year was trying to come up with what to write about, and how to put those ideas into words. I&#x27;m hoping to find ways of improving that this year, and maybe add some stream-of-consciousness posts as well.</p>\n<p>Those are my four main goals of 2019. Here&#x27;s to hoping that I do better this year than last.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I deleted my Facebook account in June or July, I forget which month, but I had kept my Instagram account. That ended this week when I downloaded my archive and deleted my Instagram account.</p>\n<h2>What Finally Pushed Me Over the Edge</h2>\n<p>This past week, the New York Times reported that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/technology/facebook-data-sharing.html\">Facebook had given Amazon, Spotify, Royal Bank of Canada among others access to your private messages</a>. I wasn‚Äôt horribly surprised, but it finally gave me the final kick in the ass I needed to just click ‚Äòdelete‚Äô.</p>\n<p>Now it would not surprise me to know that Facebook would do this, and it was probably buried in the permissions access that users granted to services such as Spotify. I had linked my Facebook account at one point to Spotify and it‚Äôs likely that I would have missed it as well. I also wouldn‚Äôt expect Spotify to need read access to my private messages, and I‚Äôd wager that others would think the same. I understand why it would need write access as I and others have shared tracks through Facebook Messenger, but why would Spotify need to read my messages...I can log into Facebook for that. So with all of that in mind, I decided the supposed benefits just weren‚Äôt worth it anymore and got rid of my account...permanently.</p>\n<h2>What I‚Äôll Miss</h2>\n<p>I think the two biggest things that I‚Äôll miss from Instagram would be seeing what my friends are up to and what the local craft breweries are releasing. It will kind of suck not having this anymore, but I‚Äôm just done with Facebook. I‚Äôve been more aware and active with regards to my privacy and I don‚Äôt trust Zuckerberg and company to make any correct decisions when it comes to keeping my data secure.</p>\n<h2>My Privacy Kick</h2>\n<p>Over the past year, I‚Äôve been focused more and more on protecting my privacy. I‚Äôve switched to Firefox over Chrome and have been migrating away from Google as well. Facebook was obviously an issue and I can say that it‚Äôs been dealt with as best as I can. I‚Äôll write up more on that later down the line, but for now, goodbye Facebook and good riddance!</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I figured it was a good way to teach myself React and Node.js, much like OpenVoter taught me PHP. I‚Äôve been wanting to familiarize myself with some more modern frameworks, and I feel like Node and React are good places to start.</p>\n<p>The project I‚Äôve been working on is called Digital Family Cookbook. It‚Äôs basically a cookbook web application meant for families. I know my wife and I have plenty of recipes, and it can often be a challenge to figure out where they‚Äôre saved. I‚Äôve saved a bunch within Google Drive, but I also have them in Evernote, and several other places. I figure a good project would be to make a website that I can centralize them in so if one of us needs to make dinner, we don‚Äôt have to remember where the recipe is or ask where it is.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve gotten plenty of false starts on this one. I originally wrote it in PHP 3+ years ago. I re-wrote it using Ruby on Rails shortly after and had it sort of up and running. That ended when I started having issues with my Rackspace server and realized that it was cheaper to host the sites I cared about on Amazon Web Services.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that, my wife and I bought a house, so a lot of my time and resources went into housework (it never ends). But now that I have some time to breathe, I figured I‚Äôd jump back in and rebuild this as a learning project.</p>\n<h2>The First Start</h2>\n<p>I originally started the project to be a full fledged web application allowing for people to sign up for accounts and host it all for everyone. I decided to create 2 separate projects. One for the front end, and then one for the API on the back end. I figure I‚Äôd try to be ambitious and sort of plan ahead for potential mobile apps and writing the backend once for an API would probably make things easier down the road.</p>\n<p>I was making a fair amount of progress on it. Learning some of the ins and outs of how React worked, as well as some of the intricacies of Node.js and the newer functionalities of JavaScript/ES6. I even had a rudimentary admin console all set up for administrators.</p>\n<p>In the end though, I decided that I didn‚Äôt really have the time or desire to run a website publicly. I figured it‚Äôd be too time-consuming to make sure that spammers, scammers, and other bad actors weren‚Äôt abusing the application. My ambition for this project might‚Äôve been a little high, but I realized that to handle something like this was a little too much for my tastes at the moment.</p>\n<h2>Starting Over</h2>\n<p>I still liked the idea of the app, but figured I‚Äôd go with a scaled down version. I‚Äôd basically make it more along the lines of a downloadable CMS rather than a centrally run site. I‚Äôd open source it much like OpenVoter, and just let others download it and run it on their own server if they want. I have no idea if anyone will, but figure why not? It solves a problem for me, maybe it could solve a problem for someone else.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I was able to use what I already wrote as a guide for the new version of the project. I‚Äôm still going with 2 projects, the web portion, and then the API. My ambitions might be scaled back, but they aren‚Äôt so scaled back as to not think I won‚Äôt want to write a mobile application for the cookbook.</p>\n<p>My initial version of the new app used Bootstrap for the UI, but after listening to several software development podcasts talking about the virtues of CSS Grid and other more modern CSS tools, I decided that I might as well go with my own custom CSS code. I figure it can‚Äôt hurt, the few tutorials I did on CSS Grid showed me how powerful it can be and I already have a few ideas on how I want to integrate it.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs basically where I am now. I have the skeleton of the app laid out and now I‚Äôm writing more code and making progress. For the first time in a while, I actually feel good with where I‚Äôm at with it. There‚Äôs still plenty to do, but now I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like I‚Äôm flailing around trying to find solid ground to start off on.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll try to write more updates on the journey I‚Äôm taking writing this app as it progresses towards completion.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

There were views from all across the spectrum. Some were saying that it was awful, while others were more optimistic about it. Elsewhere in the community, it has gone so far that GitLab, one of GitHub‚Äôs bigger competitors, even saw a <a href=\"https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1\">large spike of project imports</a>, likely because of the acquisition. I know I saw somewhere that SourceForge was even trying to court devs to move their projects to their platform.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll admit, my initial reaction to the news was along the lines of ‚Äúuh oh‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Having several days to ruminate on it though, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm nearly as pessimistic as I used to be. I‚Äôd actually say that I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic. Microsoft definitely has had their share of acquisitions turning into horrors (see Skype), but the current Microsoft is quite different compared to the Microsoft of old.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has the reputation, and rightly earned, of being hostile towards open source and the open source community. They have quite a lot of past bad acts to make up for. That said, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft since 2014, has generally done a pretty good job with regards to the developer community. Microsoft has embraced the open source community, even going so far as to allow you to run Linux within Windows 10. Their .NET architecture even runs on Windows, MacOS, &amp; Linux. I‚Äôm hopeful that with these changes, they can make GitHub even stronger for developers.</p>\n<p>Now, my optimism doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt have my concerns. Microsoft is a large company and they have their own version control system (VCS) in Team Foundation Server (TFS) that mirrors a lot of what Git and GitHub do. Git is of course not part of this acquisition, but it is the VCS that GitHub is built off of. My hope is that Microsoft keeps the two separate for the most part. Let the better parts of each system rub off on each other, but I don‚Äôt want to see any improvements of GitHub abandoned or semi-abandoned in favor of TFS.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs still way to early to make any real judgements. It could be a year or more before the effects become noticeable. I‚Äôm going to keep my cautious optimism, and withhold my judgement for the time being. I‚Äôd encourage you to do the same.</p>\n<h3>One More Note</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôll say this though, the acquisition has created plenty of new memes in the development community ranging from bringing back Clippy to making fun of the constant annoying prompts to restart your computer for updates. It‚Äôs given me a few laughs.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

If I didn&#x27;t make it fall within these constraints, the alignment of the boxes would end up being off. It wasn&#x27;t really a long-term solution that worked. I decided that a redesign was in order.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m definitely happy with how this design came out. I had a sidebar a little while back, and decided that I&#x27;d go back to a sidebar design. I searched around Dribble and other blogs I follow to see what others have done to try to come up with something for me.</p>\n<p>I decided to go with a sticky sidebar. I figured that if it wasn&#x27;t sticky, you&#x27;d have a bunch of dead space on the left of the page once you scrolled down. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of that so I made the sidebar stick to the side of the page so at least it wasn&#x27;t blank.</p>\n<p>On mobile, the sidebar slims down and becomes the header. I was slightly concerned that too much of the main page would end up cut off from the header. In the end, outside the iPhone SE, enough below the header was visible that I decided that the design would work.</p>\n<p>I might end up doing something different for the photography page, but I like the way the design turned out for the blog portion of my site.</p>\n<p>I think another, probable less glamorous part of it is that I can never seem to stick with a design. After a while, I just want to dig in and redesign it. I wish I would end up spending more time writing posts rather than re-writing the code behind it.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I decided to turn off Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. Instead of them, I opted for utilizing my subscriptions to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and The Economist. I also ended up using RSS feeds as well.</p>\n<h2>So How Did It Go?</h2>\n<p>I think the best word to explain how it went would be mixed. I stayed off Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, but I probably focused too much on staying up to date with my RSS feeds rather than much more periodic views of my NYT, WSJ &amp; Economist subscriptions. If I were to do this again, I would probably do more to limit how often I check my RSS feeds. I also visited Hacker News a little more often than I could have. I didn‚Äôt end up reading much of The Economist, and instead was focused on books.</p>\n<h2>What Did I Miss?</h2>\n<p>I think the only thing I missed was Twitter. The funny thing is that I can‚Äôt really pinpoint the exact reason I missed Twitter. I missed being able to Tweet about and read others‚Äô Tweets about hockey games. This was particularly amplified by the start of the Stanley Cup Playoffs and watching my team, the Philadelphia Flyers make it in and play (and subsequently lose 4-2 to the Penguins). But other than that, I think I just enjoy just the general brevity of Twitter.</p>\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\n<p>The news did seem to slow down some for me. I didn‚Äôt always know what was going on all the time, and I feel fine about that. I did pick up the big things from my RSS feeds and NYT &amp; WSJ newsletters, but didn‚Äôt feel bombarded by some of the news that came and went without consequence. I have to say I did like that. I do want to stay informed, but being able to let go a little from the constant onslaught was worth it.</p>\n<p>I think the big takeaway from this for me is to get my news fixes at a slower pace. I also believe this can be done even with social media. When social media is involved, I just think you need to keep in mind who you follow. I‚Äôve unfollowed most of my non-friends on Facebook so just about all of the posts I see are from my friends. The people and accounts I follow on my primary Twitter account (<a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/kpwags\">@kpwags</a>) definitely assists in this as I‚Äôve culled out most of the news sources to make it generally more enjoyable. I have a second account that follows more of the news sources for when I want to read them. I might also start to work with my lists on Twitter as well.</p>\n<p>It was definitely a worthwhile exercise and I think I‚Äôm going to try to apply some of what I‚Äôve found towards how I browse through the news.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Here‚Äôs What I Learned</a>. While there was some controversy as Farhad had posted on social media at times during the two months, I like the idea he had. For a little more details about the controversy, you can hear an interview with Farhad Manjoo and Bob Garfield in an <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/did-farhad-unplug\">On The Media Podcast Extra</a> discussing the matter.</p>\n<p>I thought Farhad had an interesting take on it, and he made a good point about the speed of news when your primary source is Twitter and other social media sites. I&#x27;ve culled my main Twitter account of most news and politics accounts, primarily focusing on technology, science, software development and other &quot;lighter&quot; topics. My experience on Twitter has become better since doing so, but even with my best intentions, plenty of news and politics still makes it into my feed.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m thinking that I want to give this a try myself. But given costs, I think I&#x27;m going to forego the paper copies of newspapers and focus on the digital versions. I currently have a digital subscription to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal. I also receive The Economist weekly. I figure given time constraints, I&#x27;ll open the apps or websites a few times a day and read what&#x27;s happening. It might not be quite the same as the paper edition, but should still slow things down a bit. I&#x27;m planning on trying to try this for the month of April.</p>\n<p>During this time, I will not be on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit. I&#x27;ll still peruse Hacker News and I&#x27;ll still be on Instagram. I figure I don&#x27;t use Instagram for news, so it&#x27;s no big deal there. Hacker News tends to focus more on tech and software development which will probably be less represented in sources such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. I&#x27;m still planning on following my RSS feeds as well, but I haven&#x27;t completely made up my mind there. I also plan to continue to listen to podcasts which will also help keep me up to date on the news.</p>\n<p>My primary reason for doing this is to see what it&#x27;s like to get news on a &quot;slower&quot; basis. I doubt I&#x27;ll leave Twitter and Reddit forever and they certainly have their place. But for the month of April, I feel like it would be a good experiment to see how it goes.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ll update after April to let you know how it goes and if I was able to stick to my plan.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I was able to skate outdoors on an ice rink in Hershey, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>The weekend prior, the AHL (American Hockey League, or the NHL minor league) held their version of the Winter Classic, the AHL Outdoor Classic. It was played outdoors at Hershey Park Stadium and was a matchup of the Hershey Bears hosting the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. Since the Phantoms are the Flyers&#x27; minor league affiliate, Lauren and I bought tickets to see the game. It was a pretty cool experience watching hockey outdoors. I just wish that I got tickets a little higher up so we could see a little bit more of the action. Happily, the Phantoms won 5-2.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey/2018-ahl-outdoor-classic.jpg\" alt=\"Skating Outdoors\" width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\"/></div>\n<p>Because they already built the outdoor rink, they decided to make some money by opening it up to the public to rent out. Reddit&#x27;s Flyers subreddit set up a 2 hour pickup game on the ice last Friday and I was able to participate.</p>\n<p>Stepping out onto the field was a surreal experience. I&#x27;ve been playing hockey for almost 5 years now, but there really is something about skating around in the open air. The pickup game was a lot of fun. The ice wasn&#x27;t as good as I was expecting or hoping as it had been up for a week with some 50-60¬∫F weather. Either way though, it was an amazing experience that I still can&#x27;t fully believe I participated in. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, even just skating around outside would be worth it.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey/outdoor-skating.jpg\" alt=\"Skating Outdoors\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\"/></div>\n            </div>\n        ",

My productivity has definitely been hampered by what&#x27;s been going on in Washington D.C. and Trump&#x27;s presidency. I know I shouldn&#x27;t let it affect me as much as it has, but at the same time, I can&#x27;t say that it hasn&#x27;t. So many of his actions have made my blood boil to the point that I become distracted, and in some cases, full of despair. Not that I can use this as an excuse for things I didn&#x27;t accomplish, but like other people, I can&#x27;t always throw current events to the back of my mind.</p>\n<p>I wish I could say I was successful at accomplishing my goals for 2017 that I laid out <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/life/2017/01/24/goals-for-2017.html\">previously</a>. At the end of the day though, I didn&#x27;t completely hit any of them. Despite this, 2017 was not a bad year.</p>\n<h3>2017 Goals Post-Mortem</h3>\n<h4>Getting Into Shape</h4>\n<p>This one I did make progress on. I didn&#x27;t really make much progress on the weight-front, but I was able to get my strength and conditioning up. My core lifts have gone up, I feel like I have more &quot;umph&quot; when skating and running. I was also able to run Broad Street (The popular 10 miler) in May, finishing with a time of 1 hour, 34 minutes which was just under my goal of 1:35.</p>\n<h4>Reading More Books</h4>\n<p>Last year I ended up reading 13 books which was below what I was hoping for, but it did end up being more than 2016. A couple of years ago when I could read over my lunch break did wonders for increasing the amount I read. I feel like I kind of shot too high, too early.</p>\n<h4>Enjoying the Outdoors</h4>\n<p>Yeah, I failed at this one. Didn&#x27;t do anything towards this one. Maybe this year.</p>\n<h4>Getting Back into My Side Projects</h4>\n<p>This one I can sort of say I&#x27;ve done. I haven&#x27;t gone full bore into it, but I&#x27;ve been slowly reading into React and Node.js trying to learn their basics for my next project. Javascript isn&#x27;t so much an issue as much as wrapping my head around some of the newer methods of doing things. I learned PHP using OpenVoter, so hopefully I can have similar success with this.</p>\n<h4>Writing More</h4>\n<p>Sadly, this is another one I haven&#x27;t done all that much of. I&#x27;ve had a bunch of ideas for posts that I started, but I never ended up finishing them. Maybe this year I can re-visit some of them or actually follow through more of my ideas.</p>\n<h4>Becoming More Involved in Politics</h4>\n<p>Yeah, didn&#x27;t do much on this either. I attended one meeting of the local Democrats in January or February, but never really followed up. I&#x27;m still interested, but I also need to beat back my cynicism and my feelings of just being jaded.</p>\n<h4>Disconnect a Little</h4>\n<p>I moved away from Facebook. I haven&#x27;t deleted my account yet, but I don&#x27;t really visit it anymore. I culled who I follow on Twitter and have tried to avoid too much politics within my feed. It&#x27;s not completely free of politics, but I do generally find it more enjoyable.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Onward to 2018</h2>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>I think I&#x27;m going to keep it a little more simple this year and focus on only four goals.</p>\n<h4>Losing the Weight (Finally)</h4>\n<p>This has got to be one of the biggest time honored traditions. People committing to losing weight January 1st, and then forgetting about it February 1st. I&#x27;m hoping to continue with this goal this year. Unfortunately, this did hit a little bit of a snag 2 weeks in as I ended up breaking the tip of my finger at the gym with a 55 lb. dumbbell...oops! Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I had feared and only ended up missing 2 hockey games and 2 weeks of strength training.</p>\n<p>My gym routine has been tweaked some more and you can view it, as well as my progress <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/gym-routine/\">here</a>. I try to keep it updated as much as possible given that I&#x27;ve been known to tweak it from time to time. I think part of that is me always wanting to try new things.</p>\n<h4>Reading</h4>\n<p>This year might be a little bit more of a challenge as well because I ended up re-subscribing to <em>The Economist</em> which is a fantastic source of news, but very in depth and not exactly a fast read. I&#x27;m trying to keep a balance between reading my books and the magazine. My <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/reading-list/\">reading list</a> has been a little more focused on non-fiction lately and probably will for the near future. I love a good story, but have been enjoying learning more about history, the world, and other people&#x27;s experiences.</p>\n<h4>Side Projects</h4>\n<p>I&#x27;m going to continue to work on my new project using Node.js &amp; React. I&#x27;ve spent a decent chunk over the last week or so, so hopefully this will continue. Despite me knowing Javascript, I&#x27;ve found that Node.js has proven a challenge for me. I&#x27;m hoping that with more focus, I can get my head around some of the new concepts and really start to make progress. I have a lot of ideas for the project and would love to be able to start to implement them and get the site off the ground.</p>\n<h4>Write More</h4>\n<p>Let&#x27;s try this one again. I&#x27;m kind of hoping that given my separation of politics away from this blog and onto it&#x27;s <a href=\"https://politics.kpwags.com\">own site</a> that I might be more willing to write what&#x27;s on my mind without inundating this blog. Plus, maybe that will help me with some frustrations of what&#x27;s going on in the government. I&#x27;m currently working on another 1,000+ word post on getting back into gaming with a review of DOOM. So keep your eyes peeled for that.</p>\n<h4>Everything Else in 2018</h4>\n<p>All too often last year, I felt like I was too busy or that I had too much going on. I&#x27;m hoping that this year is a little more calm. That said, the first month of the year hasn&#x27;t exactly lived up to that, and my schedule for February and March isn&#x27;t getting much calmer.</p>\n<p>Some of the other things I&#x27;ve been working on and will continue to work on include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Homebrewing:</strong> After Christmas, I started brewing my first beer. I just recently bottled it, so in about 2-3 weeks, I&#x27;ll find out if it&#x27;s any good. I&#x27;m hoping to continue brewing from time to time.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Games:</strong> My Steam backlog alone is huge. I&#x27;m planning on trying to play through a bunch of them and mark them as beaten. I might even write a post here and there about some of the newer, better ones.</li>\n<li><strong>House Projects:</strong> My plan is to keep up with the multitude of projects around the house. <em>Buy a house they said, it will be fun they said</em>. All jokes aside, while it can be a pain in the ass sometimes, it&#x27;s nice to have a house to call my own and have a yard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#x27;s to a better 2018.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

We got some action movies in Star Trek, Into Darkness &amp; Beyond, but nothing like The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine or Voyager.</p>\n<p>I knew once Enterprise was cancelled that the chances of a new series coming out anytime in the near future was just about slim to none. When I heard that they were rebooting Star Trek I was hopeful that a successful movie might allow for a new series. No such luck. It wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal for me anyway as I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the biggest fan of the new movies. They‚Äôre not bad movies, but none of them really speak to me the same way the TV series did or how any of the previous movies spoke to me. The thing that really drew, and still does draw me to Star Trek is the hopeful vision of the future. The new movies focus more on the action aspect of things. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy the action; it‚Äôs just not what really draws me to it.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to this past weekend with the premiere of Discovery. I watched the first episode and left with a feeling of...well, indifference. I didn‚Äôt hate it by any means. The special effects were fantastic. The story wasn‚Äôt bad, but I‚Äôm not sure how much of it I really got in just one episode. As it stands, I wasn‚Äôt truly drawn in. Star Trek TV series often have this problem though. The first seasons of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager were definitely each series‚Äô weakest seasons. I also don‚Äôt think you can really judge any television series based on a single episode, especially the pilot.</p>\n<p>This leads me to my dilemma. Star Trek: Discovery is only available on CBS All-Access. CBS All-Access costs $6 or $10 a month depending on if you‚Äôre willing to tolerate ads. Unlike the other shows on CBS, Discovery will not be broadcast past the first episode.</p>\n<p>On one hand, I want to support Star Trek and the development of future seasons and series. The special effects for Discovery were impressive. They definitely felt better than previous series which can probably be attributed to both newer technology as well as a bigger budget. I want to support this and the development of more Trek on TV and a subscription should hopefully allow for it.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand, I absolutely hate what CBS is pulling and don‚Äôt want to support it. I can‚Äôt think of any franchise that has the same pull that Star Trek does on both television and the movies. CBS knows this and is taking full advantage. How many other new shows do you think CBS (or any network) could put behind a paywall and expect the numbers of subscribers to be there? This irritates me to no end and I definitely feel taken advantage of. I figure Discovery will probably face increased piracy because of this. I won‚Äôt go that far, but I also haven‚Äôt ruled out waiting until next summer when all 15 episodes are out, getting the one week free trial, binging all the episodes and then cancelling my subscription. I also feel like CBS is basically torpedoing the series by making us Star Trek fans consider going down this route.</p>\n<p>I also can‚Äôt help but wonder if this is the future of TV and streaming. All the different stations offering their own streaming service. We‚Äôve already seen the beginning of it with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon getting exclusives. We‚Äôve seen a first hint with Disney planning their own streaming service in the next couple of years. Imagine having to pay $5-10 each for every channel you want to stream. I‚Äôm sure this is part of their plans to try to make those planning to cut the cord think twice about it. But imagine if ABC, NBC, Comedy Central, and others each made you buy into their own services in addition to cable and broadcast like CBS is doing. (Now they can get double the payments!) The costs are going to add up fast. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon at least add more value due to their diverse and large selection of TV series and movies. CBS doesn‚Äôt even provide full access to their back catalogue.</p>\n<p>I still haven‚Äôt decided what I‚Äôm going to do about Discovery and CBS All-Access. I might very well just suck it up and buy the subscription to watch the series, or I might just wait until the end and binge watch it. Either way, I‚Äôm not sure I like where the future of streaming is heading.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

            "content_html": "\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Recently, much has changed in regards to my presence on social media.</p>\n<p>Back in February I decided that I had had enough of Facebook and left the service. I didn‚Äôt deactivate or delete my account, I simply signed out and deleted the apps from my phone &amp; tablet. Suffice it to say, I have yet to look back.</p>\n<p>I had several reasons for making this decision.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>Facebook is of course known for the fact that they do everything they can to grab every bit of information about you. They find out who your friends are, what you like to eat, what you like to drink, your political views, and so much more. The scary thing, and this is by no means limited to Facebook, Google does it too, is that you don‚Äôt even have to be explicit about it. Facebook can figure out so much that all the little hints that you drop along the way in what you like and share can give it away. There was a story several years ago where <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#3078e64b6668\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target found out someone was pregnant before her father even found out</a>. Think about that, and then imagine something far more detailed, and far more invasive. I‚Äôm still on Instagram though, which is owned by Facebook. The privacy thing still bothers me there, but privacy alone isn‚Äôt the only reason I left.</p>\n<h3>Echo Chamber</h3>\n<p>Facebook‚Äôs algorithm gets a lot of press on how it really tailors what we all see and read about to our tastes. Facebook generally wants to keep us on the site, so showing us too many articles that we disagree with can end up hurting that goal. The problem that arises from that, is that when it comes to politics and ideas, we might only see those thoughts and ideas that correspond with our own rather than challenge us. I‚Äôm certainly sometimes guilty of too quickly writing off conflicting ideas as simply being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù without looking at the meat of the argument. To not even be given the other viewpoints though ends up weakening the dialogue.</p>\n<p>The other side of this is that we as humans tend to stick with people we agree with. It‚Äôs natural to do this. The downside here though is that all too often, it shows in the feeds. Even without Facebook‚Äôs algorithm, we still only see our side of the argument.</p>\n<p>Given that my Facebook profile has content that I really don‚Äôt want strangers to have easy access to (I keep most things private on Facebook), becoming friends with people outside my social circle isn‚Äôt an option to get alternate views, and if I wanted to follow right-leaning publications, there are better places to do it than on Facebook. Before I left Facebook, I culled my likes and follow list to essentially just friends, not really pages and groups. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say there is that I don‚Äôt really feel like using Facebook as a news aggregator, more as a way to keep up with my friends and family.</p>\n<p>One last thing on this point, Christie Aschwanden, a writer for FiveThirtyEight had a great point on how <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/leaving-social-media-taught-me-how-broken-the-news-cycle-is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media sort of points you in the direction of what to read</a>. Reading the news more like the morning paper rather than whatever your friends recommend has so far seemed to help me see more sides to things that I had been previously. Nothing‚Äôs perfect mind you as even publications like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal can try to funnel you into various stories, more often than not, you‚Äôll see a lot more than you would through social media.</p>\n<h3>Time Sink</h3>\n<p>Let‚Äôs face it, social media is a huge time sink. Many people, myself included, spend so much time following their feeds on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. I noticed I was spending far too much time on Facebook. It wasn‚Äôt the only thing on my phone or laptop I was wasting time on, but it was definitely the biggest.</p>\n<h3>Beyond Facebook</h3>\n<p>After I left Facebook, I also ended up spending less time on Reddit as well. The one site I ended up moving a little bit more to was Twitter. At the time I justified it by following some right-leaning accounts and news sources, but it ended up being somewhat of a time sink as well. All the politics drained me as well, so in mid-June, I ended up leaving Twitter as well. The only two social media platforms I really visited with any regularity were Instagram and Hacker News. I love photography and technology so both of those fit in for what I was looking for without much of the other stuff that ends up tagging along with Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<h3>Going Forward</h3>\n<p>I still have no interest in returning to Facebook. Given that it‚Äôs still a connection to friends and family, I don‚Äôt see myself deactivating or deleting my account, but I‚Äôm not going to be logging on. As for Reddit, I still occasionally peruse the site, but the apps are gone from my iPad and phone, and I don‚Äôt spend that much time there. Recently, I decided to really cull who I follow on Twitter. Outside of a VERY small handful of people, I stopped following all news &amp; politics accounts regardless of what political leaning they had. Basically I‚Äôm trying to keep my Twitter feed to science, tech, development, sports, and beer feeds. While I‚Äôve only been back for a handful of days at this point, I have to say it feels more enjoyable than being inundated with the latest happenings of Washington. I still like to keep up with what‚Äôs going on, but I think I‚Äôll use podcasts and my subscription to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal to help me out there.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It might not have been the best weekend as I had a graduation party Saturday night and a Phillies game Sunday with the family, but on Friday after work I decided I was going to sit down and look into React.</p>\n<p>Looking at React made me realize that outside of work, I might have fallen behind some with where things currently are in the world of software and web development. For the last several years, all I‚Äôve really done are some basic websites and stuff for my jobs in the .NET world. I haven‚Äôt really dug into a side project or kept up which can definitely be harmful for software developers.</p>\n<p>Looking at my calendar, the month of August thankfully doesn‚Äôt look too busy. I‚Äôm hoping that I can spend some evenings digging into several new (to me) languages and technologies. My plan to start is to look at ES6, React &amp; Node.js. I figure others might pop up during my exploration so I‚Äôll just have to see where I wind up.</p>\n<p>Back to this past weekend‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>On Friday, I ended up starting out with the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html\" title=\"Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial</a> on React‚Äôs official site. I‚Äôm still getting used to the syntax and some of the new functionality of ES6, but I think I‚Äôm beginning to understand the basics of how it works. I still have a ways to go before I‚Äôm ready to really start developing, but sometimes the first step is the hardest. I think this is basically is my problem. I‚Äôm overwhelmed by how far it seems I‚Äôve fallen behind, and am struggling to take that first step up the ladder to climb out of this little hole.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm confident that if I put my mind to things, I can do it, I just have to avoid the distractions that pop up and really focus. I still want to do my recipe site, but I might end up writing it in something other than Rails depending on how this all goes.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Our recipes are mixed around between Evernote, Google Drive, and random browser bookmarks. It isn‚Äôt the most efficient system and when once of us ends up cooking, it‚Äôs not always easy to remember where the recipe is stored. I built a little tool using Ruby on Rails and deployed it. It worked, but it was kind of clunky, not all that pretty, and rather quickly I forgot about it.</p>\n<p>The initial version was primarily meant to be a down and dirty version of it. Get it to work and then optimize it and make it better later. I even built it with the idea that people could download it and install it on their own servers if they like. While there are other services out there, it‚Äôd be nice to know that you control the data &amp; recipes so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about the services shutting down and all your saved recipes go out the window. If you hadn‚Äôt guessed, the improvements never ended up happening. The code worked, but that was about the extent of it. It also didn‚Äôt help that Lauren and I ended up buying a house and had project after project lined up, which took up much of our time. So now I‚Äôm looking into reviving the project. I ended up shutting down the server it was running on, and I‚Äôm pretty much just going to throw out the old code and start fresh.</p>\n<p>I built a quick outline of it in Ruby on Rails 5.1, but I also haven‚Äôt fully committed to using Ruby on Rails. It has been a long time since I really had a side project to work on. My last big side project was OpenVoter, the Digg-clone CMS. I built that using PHP, which on a side note, was actually how I learned PHP. Since then, I haven‚Äôt really done much development outside of work where I develop in the .NET stack with some Javascript as well. Part of me feels overwhelmed looking at what platforms and libraries are out there between React, Node.js, Angular.js, and countless others. I‚Äôve been battling my urge to go all gung-ho into this and to also do research into the different options to see what would be best. I also haven‚Äôt decided whether I want the whole project to be a CMS to download and install like before, or whether I want to do the platform route. My inclination is to continue the route of making it downloadable and installable on private servers like before, but the social aspect of allowing a central server is appealing.</p>\n<p>Either way, over the next couple of months, I‚Äôm hoping to get some work done on it and hopefully nailing down how I‚Äôm going to build it, what languages and frameworks I‚Äôm going to use, and maybe even a working prototype. Stay tuned.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It was the first year since at least 2012 that I didn‚Äôt run a single race. No 5k, no half-marathon, no nothing. I was supposed to run a 15k and a 10 miler, but the weather was awful and rainy (I HATE the rain) both days so I just decided to forego the races. In terms of my weight and body fat percentage, I really didn‚Äôt make any progress with either, which was my own fault. I never really was able to get my meal plans working. I was able to increase my main lifts though so it wasn‚Äôt a horrible year.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm going to make a concerted effort to do better with my diet and of course continue to hit the gym and go for runs and bike rides. If I can really push myself to stick with my diet, I think I‚Äôll do better this year. In terms of races, I‚Äôm probably going to aim for a couple 5k races and a half-marathon or two. I‚Äôd like to beat my 2:15 half marathon record. Maybe I‚Äôll try to do the Philly Half-Marathon this year.</p>\n<h3>Read More Books</h3>\n<p>Last year I ended up subscribing to <em>The Economist</em> magazine. The magazine was a fantastic weekly source of news and what‚Äôs going on in the world, but its also time consuming to read. It kept my book reading time down and I‚Äôm hoping to get back into books. I‚Äôm currently on book 4 of <em>The Expanse</em> series by James SA Corey and I have to say it‚Äôs a fantastic series, and a good show (the few episodes I‚Äôve seen). I still subscribe to <em>National Geographic</em>, and I haven‚Äôt completely ruled out resubscribing to <em>The Economist</em>, but for now, I think I want to stick with books. I recently put together around 30 books I want to read, with many more behind it. I would like to hit 25 books this year so we shall see.</p>\n<h3>Enjoy the Great Outdoors</h3>\n<p>Growing up, I was in Boy Scouts and made Eagle Scout as well. But having moved away from my scout troop for college and having settled a little too far to really stay involved in the troop, I haven‚Äôt spent much time hiking, camping, and enjoying the great outdoors. I‚Äôve only gone on two hikes in the last 5-6 years. Once to the Pinnacle in Hamburg, PA, and the other to Ricketts Glen State Park near Wilkes Barre, PA. My trip up to Vermont in both July and October made me miss the outdoors so I‚Äôm hoping to be able to make it out this year to do more camping trips. I have a lot of the basic gear from my Scouting days so I might see if Lauren or someone else would want to go enjoy the great outdoors. I might look for a local Boy Scout Troop to volunteer with too.</p>\n<h3>Get Back Into My Side Projects</h3>\n<p>After college, I started developing OpenVoter as a side project, and while it might not have exactly taken off (not that I was hugely surprised), I really enjoyed being able to spend some of my time working on it. Since then, I haven‚Äôt done much outside of my blog and a few little things here and there. I have some ideas for some new projects, so I‚Äôd like to spend some time delving into the details and see which, if any I want to pursue. I might also delve more into Node.js and see if it makes sense to use that for anything.</p>\n<h3>Write More</h3>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt write that much at all last year which was kind of disappointing. That said, I‚Äôm hoping to to change that this year. If I can do one, maybe two posts a month, I think that will be good. I have some other things I might want to write as well so we‚Äôll see how it goes this year.</p>\n<h3>Become a Little More Involved with Politics</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt really completely know how to word this one. Anyone who knows me or follows me on Twitter, knows that I definitely slant liberal and do not like the fact that Donald Trump won the presidency. I feel his election is problematic for a whole host of reasons that would be a post in and of itself. My goal this year is to get involved, at least at a local level and as Ghandi put it, ‚ÄúBe the change that you wish to see in the world.‚Äù I‚Äôve made several calls to my representatives and senators to make my voice heard. I‚Äôve never done that before. I sent the occasional email for some issues, but I‚Äôve never been so angry and motivated to make sure my representatives know how I feel (respectfully of course). I‚Äôm not sure what that involvement will include at the moment, but I know someone in the local Democratic Party, so my plan is to talk to him and see what I can do.</p>\n<h3>Disconnect a Little</h3>\n<p>All too often, I pick up my phone and mindlessly browse Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, or something else. My goal this year is to disconnect some. I deleted Facebook &amp; Reddit from my phone and will hopefully stick with that. I‚Äôve toyed with the idea of deactivating my Facebook account, but for the time being, I think I‚Äôll just stick to browsing it once in a while on my laptop, desktop or tablet. Essentially just get it off of the device in my pocket.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say, I‚Äôm going to try to be a little ambitious this year. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be 100% successful in everything, but I figure if I can hit bits and pieces of each one, I‚Äôll be happy.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

(It&#x27;s amazing that even a year after closing, it&#x27;s still kind of hard to believe I own a home).</p>\n<p>In January, we had our only significant snowfall of the year and season. And I have to say, it was a pretty sight, especially when I didn&#x27;t have to clear the driveway. But I guess that&#x27;s why I bought a snow blower.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-in-review/snow.jpg\" alt=\"Snow\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\"/></div>\n<p>In February, my wife and I discovered that our dining room had wood paneling behind the wallpaper which threw a wrench in our plans of taking down the wallpaper and painting plans. Our whole house was wallpapered, which isn&#x27;t really our style, but taking down wallpaper, while a major pain in the ass, isn&#x27;t exactly difficult. Painting would definitely give it a freshening up that isn&#x27;t terribly expensive. All the other rooms look 100x better now than they did the day we closed on the house.</p>\n<p>The dining room was an addition to the house I want to say in the 1970s sometime, and we knew the walls weren&#x27;t plaster like the rest of the house (a simple knock on the wall told us that much). But we had (falsely) assumed that it was drywall underneath the wallpaper. Oh boy. Thinking about it, knowing we would have to do something, we decided we were going to tear down the wood paneling, and while we were at it, vault the ceiling. The dining room ceiling was no higher than 7 foot, so it felt cramped. If we were going to tear out the walls, we might as well raise the ceiling too.</p>\n<p>In mid-March, the demolition began.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-in-review/diningroomdemo.jpg\" alt=\"Dining Room Demolition\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\"/></div>\n<p>To our surprise, the studs on the ceiling were these gorgeous reclaimed wood beams. (Ignore the nasty wiring, we ended up replacing all of it.)</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-in-review/diningroombeams.jpg\" alt=\"Dining Room Beams\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\"/></div>\n<p>Needless to say, that completely changed our ideas for the final look of the room. The only thing we can figure is the previous owner built the addition with whatever materials he either had on him or could get cheapest. The next 9 months, pretty much right up to Christmas, was spent renovating the dining room. We had to re-stud the walls, run all new wire, insulate, drywall and spackle, paint, install trim, and more. It took MUCH longer than we anticipated, and there&#x27;s still some finishing touches left to do, but the end result looks amazing.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-in-review/diningroomfinal.jpg\" alt=\"Dining Room Final\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\"/></div>\n<p>Over the summer, I also had the bright idea to play on 3 different hockey teams. I love playing hockey, but 3 teams was slightly excessive. As much as I love it, playing 3-4 times a week took its toll. This also didn&#x27;t help with the home renovations either. I&#x27;m back down to 2 teams, and it seems like the happy medium. Often times more than once per week, but not really more than twice.</p>\n<p>In September, Lauren and I spent the week in Cape May, NJ. It was a nice, relaxing vacation. Not much to say about it other than it was relaxing and a beautiful week to be there. One nice part was that we discovered <a href=\"http://capemaybrewery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cape May Brewing Company</a>. We spent an afternoon at their tasting room and ended up coming home with 2 growlers full of delicious beer.</p>\n<p>Just under 2 weeks after getting back, Lauren and I went to Vermont for our anniversary. We had gone up to the Mount Snow area for my brother&#x27;s wedding in July and while it was cloudy and rainy, it was definitely beautiful. We decided that it would be a great destination in the fall with the leaves changing. We ended up staying in a little AirBnB apartment in Wilmington, Vermont; a small little town with a lot of charm. It was absolutely gorgeous. We spent a few days just wandering around taking pictures (that I&#x27;m still going through). We met up with some of our friends from Maine in Concord, New Hampshire one day. We also checked out several craft breweries. We visited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://madisonbrewingco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><p>Madison Brewing Company in Bennington, Vermont</p></a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.elmcitybrewing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><p>Elm City Brewing in Keene, New Hampshire</p></a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.whetstonestation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><p>Whetstone Station in Brattleboro, Vermont</p></a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.gildedotter.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><p>Gilded Otter in New Paltz, New York</p></a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only downside to where we were, was that many places seemed to close by 8 or 9 pm. But take that away, it was a great trip and I would totally go back again.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-in-review/vermont.jpg\" alt=\"Wilmington Vermont\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\"/></div>\n<p>In terms of my fitness goals, it was a mixed bag. I didn&#x27;t really get anywhere on my weight or body fat percentage, but I was able to notable increase my strength. At the end of the year I had hit 200 lbs. on bench press, 305 lbs. on deadlifts, &amp; 245 lbs. on squats. In terms of running, I had started to get back into running after running the marathon in 2015, but it was also the first year in a while I didn&#x27;t run a single race, 5k, half marathon or otherwise. I was supposed to run a 15k and Broad Street, but both days, the weather was crummy and while I wanted to run them, but rain makes me miserable and I guess I just didn&#x27;t want it enough. I&#x27;m hoping to run at least one half-marathon this year.</p>\n<p>It was a good year. Too much to really hit everything in a single blog post, but I&#x27;m looking forward to 2017.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

As predicted, the iPhone 7 will no longer have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Now that the dust has settled somewhat, I figured I‚Äôd throw in my two cents.</p>\n<p>Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller claimed that the reason Apple did it was <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">courage</a>. I heard that, and had I been drinking something, it might have come back up through my nose. Apple says that it takes courage to try something new. I personally find that to be a load of BS. Look, I get it, its old technology, but it‚Äôs still the de facto standard. Removing it is going to make it difficult for a lot of people to listen to their music on their phones. Apple is providing headphones that plug into the lightning port which isn‚Äôt bad until you realize that you can‚Äôt charge your phone and listen at the same time (this is also ignoring that I feel the standard headphones are uncomfortable in the ear anyway, but that‚Äôs a different story). They also are nice enough to include a lightning to 3.5mm adapter, which is also sweet...until...wait for it...you can‚Äôt charge and listen to your headphones at the same time. <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-iphone-7s-first-headphone-and-charge-dongle-isnt-coming-from-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Belkin released a dongle that allows you to plug in 2 lightning cables into your phone</a>, ostensibly one for your headphones and one for the power cable. This is all well and good, until you realize you will then need 2 dongles to listen to 3.5mm headphones and charge your phone at the same time.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7/belkin-adapter.jpg\" alt=\"Belkin iPhone adapter\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"/></div>\n<p>It‚Äôs just an ugly solution. Ignoring the fact that I personally would want multiple adapters and dongles to keep with me at my various locations so I don‚Äôt constantly have to move them around and potentially lose them, it‚Äôs just obnoxious. Add to this the incompatibility with the Apple computers (Macbook, Macbook Pro, iMac, etc) and it‚Äôs kind of a WTF moment.</p>\n<p>People have also made the argument that it allows the phone to be slightly thinner. Thinner isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, but hardly what determines my buying decisions (within reason of course). I might‚Äôve been willing to buy this argument, except for the fact that there is still a bump in the phone for the camera lens. Couldn‚Äôt you just make the phone a little thicker and make the lens flush with the case? This would probably allow enough room to re-add the 3.5mm jack!</p>\n<p>Instead Apple wants to add their own proprietary standard to things making it difficult for people to move in and away from their platform. I love me Apple products, I think they‚Äôre great pieces of technology that are incredibly functional, well designed, and a pleasure to use. I just don‚Äôt know I can even begin to get behind this change, which is a shame because of all the other improvements Apple put into the iPhone 7 and the improvements they‚Äôve made with iOS10 (which I love on my iPhone 6 by the way). Despite how I feel, I haven‚Äôt completely ruled out upgrading to the iPhone 7, but I‚Äôm currently leaning towards either sticking with my iPhone 6 or waiting to see what <a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/01/google-will-announce-pixel-phones-4k-chromecast-google-home-daydream-vr-viewer-on-october-4th/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google brings with their rumored Pixel and Pixel XL phones in early October</a>.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs also rumors of Apple inquiring about the 3.5mm headphone jack in the Macbook Pro. This would likely mean the same thing there as well. All I can say to that is NO!</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7/michael-scott-no.gif\" alt=\"Michael Scott - NO\" width=\"240\" height=\"196\"/></div>\n            </div>\n        ",

The more I think about this, the more I feel like this is a mistake on Apple‚Äôs part.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve seen people compare this change to the whole idea of Apple getting rid of the 3.5‚Äù floppy drive in the past, and more recently the optical drives. But here‚Äôs the difference between the standard headphone jack and the floppy and optical drives, the floppy drive and the optical drives were already on their way out. Apple just decided to be the one of the first to move on from them. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I tried to put a DVD in my Macbook Pro only to remember I don‚Äôt have one. Simply put, I just don‚Äôt miss it.</p>\n<p>This is most definitely not the case when it comes to the headphones port. The 3.5mm headphones jack is still dominantly used with headphones. To simply remove it will make it that much more difficult for people to listen to music, podcasts, video, and anything else with an audio track on their phones.</p>\n<p>There will most likely be a lightning adapter to allow people to plug in their old headphones, one might even come with a lightning port as well so you can charge your phone and listen at the same time. This still misses the point though. People will need to carry one more thing around with them in order to listen.</p>\n<p>Bluetooth headphones are of course a second option but they come with their own drawbacks such as keeping them charged and generally lower sound quality as well. I have two pairs of these for use at the gym, but generally use my earbuds and over the head headphones for most of my listening.</p>\n<p>The other thing to keep in mind is if Apple releases a new type of headphones that interfaces with the lightning port is the whole idea of lock-in. Apple is generally known for keeping people locked into their platform and the lightning port is no exception. The lightning port is only used in Apple devices and to bring lightning headphones into existence means that people who want to use these headphones are pretty much forced to use Apple devices or to possibly get an adapter to make it compatible with Android devices or say a Macbook Pro. Essentially the headphones will work on iPhones and iPads‚Ä¶and not much else.</p>\n<p>Now one thing that could make this whole thing interesting is if Apple continues down the USB-C path. The current Macbook has a USB-C port, which is a standard and from my understanding, a good one too. If Apple decides to use USB-C on the iPhone 7, and opts for USB-C headphones (whatever they might look like), that could make things interesting. Since USB-C is used beyond Apple devices (Android has several USB-C phones), lock-in wouldn‚Äôt occur assuming other platforms open up for Audio through the USB port. I‚Äôm not exactly holding my breath for this option, but I suppose it‚Äôs possible.</p>\n<p>Could whatever Apple is coming up with be better than the 3.5mm headphones jack? Given its age, it‚Äôs certainly due for disruption. I just question forcing it over right now when the 3.5mm jack is such widely used on a regular basis is a good idea. I‚Äôm currently in a holding pattern trying to decide what I want to do for my next phone. I‚Äôm not sold on something new, but will go into the upcoming announcement with an open mind. If the headphones port is removed and its replacement isn‚Äôt something that seems workable, I might end up moving back to Android before I end up getting locked into a single platform and ecosystem.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

A little over a month ago, I ended up gutting my dining room to re-do it so I was spending some of my evenings working on that in lieu of the gym since I‚Äôd be exhausted and unable to work if I went to the gym. I mean it‚Äôs not the end of the world as I do want to have the dining room finished as soon as possible, but I could have been better.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the dining room has also impacted my kitchen as they‚Äôre right next to each other. In an attempt to lessen the constant cleaning of the kitchen, my wife and I have been making crockpot meals since they require less cooking and are generally easier to make. While most of them are healthy, some of them could probably be healthier. Again, combined with the lower activity levels, my diet really needs to be cleaned up some. I‚Äôve been trying to cut, but my cravings all too often get the better of me.</p>\n<p>The nicer weather has allowed me to get out and run a little bit. I was going to run Broad Street, Philly‚Äôs popular 10 mile run May 1st, but it was pouring and a little chilly so I decided to pass on it this year as I didn&#x27;t want to get myself sick. I think I‚Äôm still going to keep my focus on the gym as I‚Äôve been making progress on my lifts, and want to keep doing so. I‚Äôm going to be on 3 hockey teams over the summer and that might limit my ability to make it to the gym as often as I‚Äôd like, but I‚Äôm still going to keep on trying.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs hoping that May is a better month for me.</p>\n<p>Here&#x27;s my progress for the month of April compared with the end of March</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days Active:</strong> 17</li>\n<li><strong>Trips to the Gym:</strong> 8</li>\n<li><strong>Number of Runs:</strong> 8</li>\n<li><strong>Distance Ran:</strong>: 18.68 miles</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Body Composition</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight (Change):</strong> 181.1 lbs.

I was able to bring all of my major lifts up, and feel good about my progress there. I made some tweaks early in the month spreading my workouts out a little bit to cut down my time at the gym. I am now doing a 4 day split which is nice because it does keep the time at the gym lifting around 1 hour which I feel is the sweet spot for my life as a whole. I still do add cardio to some of the workouts, normally in the form of a 10 minute High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Treadmill Run. This is essentially why the total distance ran has decreased for February as I&#x27;ve been focusing on higher intensity rather than distance.</p>\n<p>The whole diet factor still is an issue I&#x27;m trying to correct, but I&#x27;m getting a little better.</p>\n<p>I am running Broad Street (10 miles) at the beginning of May and will likely be running a 15k at the beginning of April so I&#x27;ll probably be adding in some runs to my workouts.</p>\n<p>Here&#x27;s my progress for the month of February compared with the end of January</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days Active:</strong> 23</li>\n<li><strong>Trips to the Gym:</strong> 21</li>\n<li><strong>Number of Runs:</strong> 14</li>\n<li><strong>Distance Ran:</strong>: 29.31 miles</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Body Composition</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight (Change):</strong> 179.1 lbs.

I decided I would put a stop to this, or at least create a tool that would help put a stop to this. I created a tool that randomly chose where we went to eat. I broke local restaurants into 3 categories: Order Out, Fast Food &amp; Dine In. I then broke them out by type of food such as Mexican, Italian, etc. I put all of the recipes into a JSON file and with a tool to choose the filters and then a click of a button, it would tell us where we&#x27;re going to get food. It worked great!</p>\n<p>Thinking about it a little more, I decided that I&#x27;d try my hand at something a little more universal that other people can use. A JSON file is all nice for what Lauren and I need, but the list of restaurants probably isn&#x27;t all that useful for someone living in New York or California. In the end, I decided to use Google&#x27;s Places API to randomly choose a restaurant for anyone.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2016-02-19-i-made-a-thing/where-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg\" alt=\"Where Do You Want To Eat\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\"/></div>\n<p>All the person would need to do would be to enter their zip code and boom, a restaurant would be chosen. It worked out pretty well. But then I realized that it didn&#x27;t really give much flexibility to the result. I then decided to give the user the option to enter in a custom query to randomly choose from. In the first version of it, I defaulted the query to &quot;restaurant&quot; which works well enough, but it&#x27;s not the most specific. So I added a new textbox for users to enter their custom query to replace the default. So now, it&#x27;s even possible for users to randomly decide which shoe store to go to. Not quite the intention of the tool, but hey, it still works.</p>\n<p>The next improvement I made was to add the ability for users to choose the distance for which to look. Again, this is more to make it a little bit more granular so people can choose how far away they&#x27;re willing to go.</p>\n<p>I even decided to take it one step further and use Google&#x27;s API to help geolocate where the person using the site is. The site now asks the user to share his/her location and then extrapolates the zip code. I figured this is one less step the user has to do and could be useful if the person is out of their normal area and doesn&#x27;t know what zip code they&#x27;re in. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I don&#x27;t know many zip codes other than the ones I use on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was a pretty fun project to work on.

I think it&#x27;s shrunk over the last year or two and I have gone down in pants size, but I&#x27;ve always wanted to get rid of it in its entirety. I don&#x27;t know if that will happen this year, but I definitely want to see the majority of it go away. To that end, I&#x27;ve been making a concerted effort to go to the gym more with what I feel is a good lifting plan, and to generally just stay active.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue I&#x27;ve had with it is diet. I unfortunately love food, and I love beer. It&#x27;s not exactly a great combination. My increased activity level has most certainly helped keep myself at my current weight (hovering just below 180 lbs.) but it hasn&#x27;t allowed me to lose more weight, or decrease my body fat percentage an in turn my gut. I&#x27;ve also started to do some meal prep for work lunches. Between chili, pork and carrots, and chicken and broccoli, my lunches have generally stayed healthy. My dinners haven&#x27;t been too bad either. My biggest weakness has been weekends. Part of my issue is that during the week, I&#x27;m generally on a 3 meal schedule, whereas on the weekend, the schedule isn&#x27;t always set so rigidly. Hopefully once I can square some of it away, it will get easier, and I&#x27;ll get better with things.</p>\n<p>Life&#x27;s too short to completely give up beer, good food, and spending time out with friends and family, but it&#x27;s definitely something I can get better with.</p>\n<p>To help keep me honest, I&#x27;m going to be including the following information on my previous month&#x27;s activities and changes. For the record, when I count active days, I&#x27;m counting days where I&#x27;ve done a notable physical activity whether it be a run, a trip to the gym, playing hockey, or going for a walk.</p>\n<p>Here are my stats for January 2016.

They&#x27;re a great way to learn about a whole variety of subjects to fit your tastes. I listen to so many podcasts I unfortunately have to pick and choose which episodes I listen to based on interest levels, which for me is fine. It&#x27;d be nice to be able to listen to everything, but there just isn&#x27;t enough time in the day.</p>\n<p>At work, I&#x27;ve generally switched over to podcasts most days to help pass the time. The only time this becomes an issue is when I&#x27;m working on more complicated problems and really need to focus on what I&#x27;m doing. In this case, it&#x27;s not so much that the podcast is distracting me, but it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m not really paying attention to it as much so if there&#x27;s a story involved, which generally is the case, I hear something and have almost no context for it.</p>\n<p>The one thing I did find is that podcasts are great for running, especially distance running. Music is great to keep you pumped up and going, but what I&#x27;ve found is that when I&#x27;m running longer distances, listening to a story or dialogue distracts me just enough to keep my focus off of any pain or the drudgery of pushing myself to go that final mile. The best way to put it I guess is that I&#x27;m so focused on the podcasts, I don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m running.</p>\n<p>I listen to podcasts primarily on my phone, but also on my iPad and Nexus 7. I use the Pocket Casts app and find that it works great for what I need. It syncs my podcasts, podcast playlists, which podcasts I&#x27;ve listened to, and best of all, where I&#x27;m at in the current podcast I&#x27;m listening to in case I switch devices. It&#x27;s available on both <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS</a>, and it has a web version. Both the Android and iOS apps are great, but I&#x27;ve found the web version to be a bit buggy. It&#x27;s not a free app, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</p>\n<p>In case you&#x27;re interested, here is the current list of podcasts I listen to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a

Even almost a month later it sometimes dawns on me how amazing it is that I was able to run a full marathon (26.2 miles).</p>\n<p>In March 2010, I tried to run a 5k and failed miserably not even really able to run a mile. I finished the 5k, mostly by walking and probably annoying those running it, but it wasn&#x27;t one of my proudest moments. That was actually what sparked my decision to get myself in better shape. I started going for walks, and in June to July 2010 after I moved to Plymouth Meeting, I started going for 2-3 mile runs. Granted most of these runs included plenty of walking breaks, I was starting out well and was on my way. Slowly these runs had less and less walking breaks and my average pace started to creep down to the 12 minute mile range. In late July, I joined LA Fitness with my buddy LJ and started working on my strength training as well. I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing with regards to strength training, but I also didn&#x27;t really have much in terms of muscle, so I had to start somewhere. Well I continued to run both at the gym and around my apartment and in March 2011, 1 year later, I ran the same 5k in 34:03.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2013, I had just hurt my shoulder playing Baseball, so really, the only thing I could really do was run. Lifting weights was notably limited as my right arm was causing me pain. I went through physical therapy to fix the shoulder, but in the meantime I started running more. After successfully running almost 11 miles one Saturday, I decided to sign up for the Philadelphia Half Marathon in November 2013 and successfully ran that in 2:15:38.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, in 2014 I signed up for the Philadelphia Full Marathon in November 2014. In the meantime, I ended up running Broad Street (10 miles), and 2 half marathons during the spring and summer. Unfortunately, my left knee started giving me problems and I was unable to run the marathon in November. I went through physical therapy, got exercises to help prepare me for another try and in April 2015, I signed up to run the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon.</p>\n<p>My training started at the end of July, right after vacation, and right as my wife and I decided to buy a house. The next month was hectic with me running 4 days a week and working on the house. Training was going well until the end of September, beginning of October. I had hit a new record high of 16 miles, but started to feel pain in my right foot. I tried again a week later, and sure enough the pain was still there. I thought it was a stress fracture, but it turned out to just be inflammation thankfully (sorta). It unfortunately kept me from running for 2 weeks right in the middle of the longest runs of my training. I went to the gym and spent time on the elliptical and stationary bike in an attempt to try to keep myself active and my cardiovascular system active. Late October, early November I started running again and was able to hit 10+ miles without pain in my foot so I was hopeful I might be able to pull the marathon off after all. I probably should have trained a little more, but on November 22nd, I gave the Philadelphia Marathon my best effort and was able to complete it in 5:12:16.</p>\n<p>The pain was excruciating. Around mile 2, my right knee started hurting. At mile 17, my foot started hurting. At mile 23, I developed a blister on one of my toes. But I can proudly say I was able to persevere and finish. I like to think it was my determination to not have to train to run another marathon that helped me finish, but running 24 miles with some pretty sharp pain in my right knee was not fun. My cousin Tim met up with me in Manyunk and thankfully I had him to run the last 6-7 miles with. It made the pain a lot easier to bear. I did have to take a few more walking breaks than I would have liked, but at the end of the days, who cares, I did it! My parents, sister &amp; her boyfriend, as well as my best friend all showed up and I was in tears as I crossed the finish line.</p>\n<p>I wanted to say I ran a marathon in my lifetime, and now I can say I did so.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2015-12-17-i-finally-ran-a-marathon/marathon-complete.jpg\" alt=\"Me finishing the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon\" width=\"1920\" height=\"970\"/></div>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Ran 26.2 miles after a long journey.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It‚Äôs not my first time moving away from Wordpress, but I think it will end up being permanent.</p>\n<p>I do want to write more and I do hope to do so soon, but the fact of the matter is that in all honesty, I really don&#x27;t blog as much as I want. This lack of posts has the distinct advantage of trying in with what was the biggest difference to me between Jekyll and WordPress. Jekyll does not use or require a database.</p>\n<p>Instead, it uses files to identify the individual pages and posts. Want to add a new post? Just add a file to the posts folder with a given filename format. Jekyll is part of a new <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trend with static website generators</a> and I have to say that for my current needs, this works out perfectly.</p>\n<p>Because Jekyll just uses files to handle the posts, it makes backing up much simpler. Hell, I can just keep everything in a Git repository and I&#x27;m good to go...which is exactly what I do.</p>\n<p>As for the design, I decided I wanted something a little more simple. I do love the cover images, but decided that want really what I wanted for the new look. I decided I liked the idea of a short summary about myself in a sidebar with the main content in the main section. It&#x27;s simple, and in my humble opinion, elegant. I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of images completely and I wanted to keep something there to continue the &quot;feel&quot; of a cover image without actually having a cover image. To do this, I decided to add an image header to pages and posts that was easily able to be customized, but yet still compelling. I actually like it because I can change it between a 1, 2 or 3 image header very easily.</p>\n<p>I still have a few things I want to do to improve it. It is responsive, and looks good on both desktop and mobile. The images however, could be better optimized, so I‚Äôll probably do what I can to improve that for mobile once the holiday season is over and things calm down some. I want to make a few CSS tweaks here and there as well, but nothing major. The only thing I‚Äôm still debating on is whether I want to bother with comments. I‚Äôm leaning against it at the moment figuring people can get a hold of me on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/kpwags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> or other social media channels if they want, but of course I could change my mind down the road.</p>\n<p>As part of this change I also ended up moving my hosting from Rackspace to Amazon Web Services. I&#x27;ve been meaning to look into AWS and finally decided to give it a try. Having your own server is convenient, but there&#x27;s something to be said to not have to worry about it when you&#x27;re only running a simple blog. I still have other sites on Rackspace, but we&#x27;ll see how long they remain there.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

We‚Äôre not talking about evil ‚Äúhackers‚Äù here going in and stealing credit card and social security numbers. This law can be used to go after people for petty mischief, acts that one would generally just shrug off are now being charged as felonies.</p>\n<p>After Aaron Swartz died, there was a push to narrow the law to have it make more sense to what its intent really was. The amendment, nicknamed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act&amp;redirect=no#Aaron_Swartz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aaron‚Äôs Law</a> would have decriminalized terms of service violations and help prevent people from being charged criminally for something that shouldn‚Äôt belong in the courts.

This meant that I needed to start going back to the gym. Well, my normal gym routine generally has been 30 minutes of cardio followed by about 1 hour on the weights. It&#x27;s actually a workout that I&#x27;ve been enjoying. The only downside, is that I don&#x27;t get back home until around 8pm. By the time I get home, shower and eat, it&#x27;s close to 9pm and I&#x27;m tired and don&#x27;t really want to do much other than rest, relax and spend time with my wife.</p>\n<p>The other thing that&#x27;s been taking up my time is hockey. I&#x27;m in 2 leagues which has been keeping me quite busy. My C-League team didn&#x27;t have that many games to start the season, which meant that in the latter half of the season, there are plenty of games. That, in addition to my I-League season, I&#x27;m playing 2-3 times a week. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I absolutely love it, but it&#x27;s been keeping me occupied. At one point I&#x27;ve had hockey 3 nights in a row. Come to think of it, it&#x27;s going to happen again this Sunday, Monday &amp; Tuesday. Oh boy‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>I also signed up for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon so I&#x27;m going to be starting to train for that pretty soon. I&#x27;m excited because the physical therapy and exercises they gave me to do have seemed to help. A couple weeks ago I was able to run 9 miles without knee pain which is a good sign as my 2014 marathon was derailed by knee pain at the 7 mile mark. I found a training program that should be doable and it&#x27;s already entered into my calendar.</p>\n<p>I also have 2 new projects I&#x27;ve been working on that I&#x27;ll go into details about soon, but for now, I&#x27;ll just say that I&#x27;m excited about it.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

My blog had its own simplistic look, and my photography site was just out there with no real tie to my blog other than my name being in the header.</p>\n<p>The first thing that really made me want to move past my old photography site was The Daily Shot. It was a good idea, at least I think it was, but I found that I never really found all that much to take photos of. That, and I felt like the photos I were taking were becoming more and more repetitive.</p>\n<p>The second thing was that the site just felt clunky to me. I developed it to try and keep it as a one page site more or less, but never really felt that it worked all that well, especially factoring in the responsiveness of the website.</p>\n<p>So I decided to scrap The Daily Shot and start from scratch with building a new site. I wanted something that was visual and really stood out. I figured all I really needed was two pages. An index to give a little blurb about me and my journey into photography, and a dynamic album page to display each album.</p>\n<p>The index page wasn&#x27;t all that hard to figure out, but I decided that breaking the albums down by year might be helpful especially with tracking the journey and my improvement (hopefully) with my picture taking skills.</p>\n<p>The next part was building the individual album page. I wanted something that would stand out and really grab the attention of the visitor. I decided to go with a cover image since they&#x27;re both visual and a great way to describe the album.</p>\n<p>Once I got the cover idea nailed down, it was onto laying out the grid of photos which was super simple in comparison to figuring out the best way to do the cover responsively. The only decision I had was what do I want to have happen when a user clicks on a photo. I was thinking about adding a page for the photo but figured that would be overkill since it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m adding the ability to comment on them, so I just went with a lightbox to make out simple.</p>\n<p>I really do like the way it turned out. I feel like the visuals really stand out and sort of draw the eyes in.</p>\n<p>This led to the blog itself, I liked how the photography portion turned out so much, I decided that while I was at it, I would give my blog a facelift.</p>\n<p>The first thing I decided to do was get rid of the categories. I originally liked that idea, but over time and really not writing all that much, I decided that they really didn&#x27;t work for what I was focusing on. I also decided that I really liked the cover look of my photography redesign so I wanted to keep up the theme. Having a full screen image for the homepage made perfect sense. Having a full screen image for the about and contact pages didn&#x27;t make as much sense so I decided to just have the images take up roughly one third of the screen. The biggest challenge I had was for posts. I wanted to do full screen, but figured I wouldn&#x27;t always have a good image for each post or that maybe some posts wouldn&#x27;t really be long enough or even warrant one.</p>\n<p>My solution I think was a good one. I essentially have two ‚Äúcategories‚Äù right now. I put categories in quotes because they aren&#x27;t categories that you would think. They&#x27;re really just a type of post. One is called a Post, the other a Blurb. Posts are the longer, posts (like this one) while Blurbs are there for entries that tend to be shorter and maybe not as lengthy. Posts will have full screen covers, while blurbs will just have the smaller header image. I felt like this was a nice compromise that gave me the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>I did my best to test this across devices, so if you see something wonky or something that doesn&#x27;t look right, please let me know. Just let me know what browser/device you&#x27;re using so I can try to narrow down where the issue is.</p>\n<p>You can check out my photography site <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/photography\">here</a>.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I&#x27;ve already run Broad Street (10 miles), and have 2 more half-marathons and then a full marathon in November. Since I&#x27;ve started running back in 2010, I&#x27;ve been using <a href=\"http://www.runkeeper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Runkeeper</a> on my phone to track my runs to give myself an idea how far and how fast I&#x27;m running. It&#x27;s a pretty nice little app and service using your phone&#x27;s GPS to track how you&#x27;re doing and overlaying your path over Google Maps. But as I&#x27;ve been running more and participating in some longer races, I&#x27;ve noticed that its accuracy was starting to become questionable.</p>\n<p>When I ran the Philadelphia Half-Marathon in 2013, I used Runkeeper and found that it had me running around 14.5 miles. Given that a half-marathon is 13.1, I couldn&#x27;t imagine the officials at the Philly Marathon measured the course so far off from the official distance. Looking at the map, I found that the GPS had me sort of all over the course of the run. Rather than being in a relatively straight line across the course, it had me zigging and zagging across the course. Over the course of a 13.1 mile race, that zigging and zagging added up. I ended up having to go in and edit the map and the GPS points to make it closer to what I actually ran. I was disappointed in it, but it gave me a mostly-decent idea how I&#x27;ve been doing, and since it&#x27;s a free app and service (with a paid premium option), I can&#x27;t really complain. Plus I didn&#x27;t know how much of it was the app and how much was the phone&#x27;s GPS antenna.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the Broad Street Run and I used my phone and Runkeeper again to track my run. After finishing the race, I happened to look at the map on Runkeeper and it was pretty far off from the actual run. At one point it had me 2-3 blocks away from where I actually was. For anyone who is not familiar with Philadelphia, Broad Street is a major north-south road in Philadelphia. It is around 13 miles and it is pretty much completely straight. The fact that Runkeeper put me 2-3 blocks away, even in areas outside of Center City where there are no skyscrapers to interfere with GPS satellite reception was disappointing. Again though, I can&#x27;t say that the problem is Runkeeper or the GPS antenna in my phone.</p>\n<p>After Broad Street and with several big races coming up, I decided I wanted to find something that was a little better at tracking my runs. My friend Brian recommended a Garmin GPS watch and I ended up getting the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-GPS-Enabled-Sport-Monitor/dp/B003J2V8AC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garmin Forerunner 110</a> with a Heart Rate monitor. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 runs so far and am actually pretty happy with the results. None of the runs have been incredibly far, but looking at the maps, it seems that the watch is pretty accurate GPS-wise. The only thing I miss is the automatic uploading to the cloud. Runkeeper automatically uploads your activities to the cloud for you to review and see how you did, the model I have requires me to plug the watch into my computer to upload the activities to <a href=\"http://www.garminconnect.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garmin Connect</a> to review. All in all it&#x27;s minor and doesn&#x27;t bother me as it really only takes 5 minutes to complete, but it&#x27;s still something I miss.</p>\n<p>Garmin Connect actually does a pretty good job at displaying the information to you as well. It gives you a map showing your run as well as graphs showing the elevation, pace, and if you wore your heart rate monitor, your heart rate as well. You can click below for an example of what a run looks like through the Garmin interface.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCenteredShadowed__suKXZ\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2014-05-27-tracking-my-runs/garmin-connect.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Connect Run View\" width=\"1294\" height=\"1920\"/></div>\n<p>You can see that it gives you a pretty good idea of how I did based on elevation, how I was able to maintain or lose my pace as well as where my heart rate was. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this as I ramp up my runs over the next 2 weeks as I prepare for the ODDyssey Half-Marathon June 8th.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

For me it was a figuratively big jump as I have been using WordPress for years and hadn&#x27;t really thought of switching to any other platform.</p>\n<p>For me, it was also a challenge to figure out enough about Node.js to be able to set up and configure my blog with Ghost. I ended up getting it up and running on my development server, played around with it, worked on porting my theme over, and finally decided I liked it enough to switch over.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m still playing around with it, though not as much now that it&#x27;s stable. The only thing I&#x27;m trying to get working is the 404 page. Whenever I try to add my custom error page, the site constantly gives me a 503 error. One day, I&#x27;ll figure this out!</p>\n<p>I really like the writing tool. I&#x27;m still getting used to the markdown syntax, but I love the simplicity of it. It&#x27;s also nice because you can mix in HTML code with it as well to get the additional features you miss with markdown. You can just start writing and not think twice about it.</p>\n<p>I also like the overall simplicity of the platform itself. Not to knock WordPress, but there is a lot of functionality there that is not really needed for a blog. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it is a bad thing as some sites could definitely benefit from the added features, but for my needs, Ghost provides all the functionality I need.</p>\n<p>One feature that I&#x27;m waiting for Ghost to implement is scheduled posting. I would like to be able to schedule a post for the future which I was able to do with WordPress, but not with Ghost. That said, this does seem to be in the feature list for Ghost so I&#x27;m hopeful I&#x27;ll see it in the next release.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see archives functionality. I do miss the ability to view a specific month or year&#x27;s posts which doesn&#x27;t seem to be available currently, but it might be available in a later release.</p>\n<p>Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with my decision to switch over to Ghost. It seems to be a solid platform that works great for me. If you&#x27;re considering it, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a shot.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It has both an Android and an iOS app. I like it because it syncs across my devices.

Over the past week, I finally got it running on my dev server playing nicely with my Apache setup. So far I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and am contemplating whether I want to switch my blog platform over to it from WordPress, which is what I currently use.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been blogging off and on since 2007. My first blog was actually a custom blog that I first built to help myself learn PHP. Since then, I&#x27;ve generally used WordPress with various different looks. WordPress has worked well for me. I&#x27;ve gotten a decent understanding of how it works so I can build themes for it and maintain it properly. I can post from my phone and my tablet with ease through the WordPress app. Simply put, WordPress just works.</p>\n<p>So why should I even contemplate a switch? Truth be told, I still can&#x27;t come up with a great answer for this. I see other people raving about it and its simplicity for simply writing does have a certain draw to it. One of the reasons for this blog was to get me into the habit of writing and Ghost seems to do a great job at doing just that. It doesn&#x27;t yet seem to have the same support that WordPress has for plugins and whatnot, though that&#x27;s apparently in the works. Still though, I don&#x27;t really use any plugins for my blog at all except for Disqus so it probably isn&#x27;t all that big of a deal.</p>\n<p>I guess one of the biggest drawbacks (for me) I see for it is that it&#x27;s written in node.js. I have no problem with node.js, its just that I haven&#x27;t really played around with it much and would like a better understanding of it before I&#x27;m willing to run my site on it. That in itself wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I&#x27;m busy enough the way it is. Now I feel like I&#x27;m just complaining about nothing or maybe I just have too much on my plate at the moment.</p>\n<p>Either way, it&#x27;s something I am still considering, but I can&#x27;t help but to think‚Ä¶if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I went there once in elementary school and was bored out of my mind. I think there were two parts to why I was so bored. The first was that I was so used to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and how many of their exhibits were interactive. The second was that it was around the time when it was &quot;not cool&quot; to really read and study the exhibits, so trying to fit in with my peers, I opted not to care. Fast forward 10 or so years later and I&#x27;ve been wanting to go back to the museum and actually explore the museum for real this time. Needless to say, I&#x27;m glad I did. We didn&#x27;t see the entire museum, but we saw a Dark Matter planetarium show, explored the ocean, and the dinosaurs.</p>\n<div class=\"RssPostImage_imageContainerCentered__SZnE4\"><img src=\"/images/posts/2014-01-14-exploring-new-york-city/trex.jpg\" alt=\"Skeleton of a Tyrannosarus Rex at the Museum of Natural History\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"/></div>\n<p>I already miss NYC.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

Saving money means limiting your expenses. Limiting your expenses means budgeting and that is where we begin. I&#x27;ve been using a spreadsheet for the past 2 years to help with this and it&#x27;s done a decent job. I played around with Mint a while back, but could never get the hang of it enough to really utilize it. This year, I figure I&#x27;d try again.</p>\n<p>For some reason Mint can no longer connect and sync with my bank account (which I am now locked out of, so I need to call them‚Ä¶sigh) and it&#x27;s handling of budgets &amp; categories still seems clunky. I decided to budget money for &quot;fun&quot;, which could include trips to the movies, dinners, etc. Mint wants to put them all over the place in different categories and it doesn&#x27;t really seem easy to group them all together for my budgeting goals since some months might be more movie heavy while the next might be more &#x27;out-to-dinner&#x27; heavy. As far as I see them, they&#x27;re both in the same group but I&#x27;m having to go into each transaction to adjust them.</p>\n<p>The other complaint I have is goals. I&#x27;m sure the goals they have defaulted work fine. I, however just want a simple, &quot;I want to save $X a month&quot; and it is so difficult to configure. I can go into the custom goals, but even this is not set up nicely. It wants me to set up a saved goal so I set that to $X x 12, but then it takes into account how much money is already in the savings account‚Ä¶it&#x27;s a complete mess for what I want. What I want is a monthly recurring goal, that takes into account the money moved from checking into savings, being completely ignorant to what is already in savings. Just track the money moved. In the end, I just added my savings goal as a budget line-item and got rid of the goals altogether.</p>\n<p>I really don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be sticking with Mint as it really seems to be completely off for what I want. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great for some people, but for me I feel like it&#x27;s so much extra work to get it to be the tool I&#x27;m looking for.</p>\n<p>Do you use Mint or is there another tool you&#x27;d recommend as an alternative?</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

I guess part of it was all the wedding preparation and the wedding itself. There are still some days where I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m married, though I&#x27;m definitely happy I am...just seems so surreal.</p>\n<p>With that said, 2014 is fast approaching and I have several goals I would like to accomplish in the next year. I&#x27;m hoping that I can successfully accomplish most, if not all of them. I&#x27;m going to try to set them to be realistic because too many times I&#x27;ve seen people fail to accomplish their goals due to setting the bar too high. You don&#x27;t want to underachieve, but there&#x27;s still such a thing as going overboard.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first goal I have is to complete my first novel which I&#x27;ve titled Glitch&#x27;d, and to write more in general. I&#x27;m around 20,000 words so far, though I&#x27;ve slacked off a bit recently. I&#x27;m using this blog though to help keep me writing figuring it will help keep my creative juices flowing.</li>\n<li>The second goal I have is to train for, and complete a full marathon. There&#x27;s 2 I&#x27;m looking at entering. The first is the Lehigh Valley Marathon September 7. This is supposed to be a nice course that isn&#x27;t too difficult, but I&#x27;m worried about training during July and August. I was able to do some runs this past summer in the high heat and humidity, but I kept them shorter between 3 and 5 miles‚Ä¶a pretty big difference to the 26.2 a full marathon is. The other one, which I will most likely enter regardless, is the Philadelphia Marathon. This is in November, so I&#x27;d have a cooler September and October to train. I might end up doing the half at Lehigh Valley and the full in Philly too, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>\n<li>The third goal I have for myself I figure will fit in with number 2. I would finally like to lose my gut. I don&#x27;t need a six pack or sculpted abs, I just want to be slimmer in my belly. Considering I&#x27;ve lost the weight I already have, I think this is definitely attainable. That being said, I don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m looking forward to the influx of people at the gym after January 1st.</li>\n<li>I would also like to take a chunk out of my video games list. I&#x27;ve gotten so many games through Steam sales, and I would like to beat more of them. I&#x27;ve actually limited my game purchases to help with this goal.</li>\n<li>My fifth goal is to find a new project for me to work on and get off the ground. I&#x27;ve been bouncing around a lot recently with different ideas, and I&#x27;d like to find a single good idea to focus on and bring to fruition. I think I have one, but it needs some more thought with it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think that all of these goals are definitely attainable and time will tell how much I can accomplish. I feel like I&#x27;ve been able to increase my productivity over the last week or two, so I&#x27;m hopeful.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It was amazing, but this is another story.</p>\n<p>We went to Aruba for our honeymoon which obviously requires flying. Well on the flight from Atlanta to Aruba, we ended up flying off the east coast of Florida. I had the window seat and was sort of blankly staring out the window staring down at the ground when all of a sudden I happen to notice a long runway. The first thing that came to mind, being the geek I am, is me wondering if that runway is the Space Shuttle landing strip. So, I take a quick look around and what do you know, there are Launch Pads 39A and 39B where the Space Shuttle and Saturn V rockets took off from. Looking further I was even able to see the Vehicle Assembly Building and the other launch pads situated south of 39A &amp; B. I even had a chance to see what I believe was the new crawler and tower for the launch system that NASA is currently working on.</p>\n<p>The whole time staring down at the ground I&#x27;m completely geeking out. Here is something that I love right beneath me by about 40,000 feet. I&#x27;ve always been interested in NASA and space travel and exploration so to be able to see it from above with my own eyes was amazing. I&#x27;ll have to go back there again one day.</p>\n<p>Lauren definitely understood my reaction, and was happy I was able to see something I love, but those around me probably thought I was nuts. Oh well.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",

It&#x27;s still there, you can still download and use it, but it just hasn&#x27;t been updated. Kind of sad too, because some updates were actually pretty far along for the next version. That said, if I ever end up going back to work on it, it might very well take a fair amount of time to figure out where exactly I left off. But going back to the time that I decided to move on from OpenVoter, I remember debating what I wanted to do somewhat heavily. I really liked what I was able to accomplish with it, but at the same time, it wasn&#x27;t really used by anyone that I knew of and didn&#x27;t really see it moving anywhere else. In the end, I begrudgingly decided to shelve it and find something else to work on.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve come up with a few ideas since then, the latest of which I&#x27;ve been on the fence about. I&#x27;ve been contemplating building an RSS reader to replace Google Reader, but I&#x27;m worried that the market has already been rather saturated and is too crowded for a little guy to get in. I have some cool ideas for it, some of them might even give it the differentiation it would need to work if I&#x27;m able to pull it off. It would definitely be a huge undertaking for me and probably more ambitious than OpenVoter. At the end of the day though, I&#x27;m not sure I want to pour my heart and soul into a project that may indeed have no real chance of succeeding. If I can get it to work, I&#x27;d definitely use it though so maybe it still would be worth pursuing. 2 years later, I&#x27;m now faced with the same decision I had with OpenVoter, only now with a different project. Do I continue on, or do I move onto something else? Even though I&#x27;m not all that far along, it&#x27;s still hard to just abandon something.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;ve been contemplating with getting into game development. I have an idea for a pretty cool game that I think I could probably pull off so maybe I&#x27;ll just move onto that.
