            <description><![CDATA[June wasn't quite as much of a waste as the numbers seem to show. I want quite as active as previous months due to work on my dining room. In March I started gutting it and now I'm finally making some real progress...at the cost of trips to the gym. I've been playing a lot of hockey as well including 3 straight weeks of Sunday-Monday-Tuesday games back-to-back-to-back. It's been tiring as well given the late start times. As much as I love playing hockey, I think I'm looking forward to dropping down to 2 teams come fall.]]></description>

I think it's shrunk over the last year or two and I have gone down in pants size, but I've always wanted to get rid of it in its entirety. I don't know if that will happen this year, but I definitely want to see the majority of it go away. To that end, I've been making a concerted effort to go to the gym more with what I feel is a good lifting plan, and to generally just stay active.]]></description>

They're a great way to learn about a whole variety of subjects to fit your tastes.

It'd be nice to be able to listen to everything, but there just isn't enough time in the day.]]></description>

I knew some basics about it, but never knew how general and open-ended it really was. It really is disturbing to me that people could be charged for simply violating the terms of service on a site like Facebook. It’s highly unlikely that the government will go after you for it, but it's still scary to know that the potential is there.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This year, I'm really starting to do some longer races. I've already run Broad Street (10 miles), and have 2 more half-marathons and then a full marathon in November. Since I've started running back in 2010, I've been using <a href="http://www.runkeeper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runkeeper</a> on my phone to track my runs to give myself an idea how far and how fast I'm running. It's a pretty nice little app and service using your phone's GPS to track how you're doing and overlaying your path over Google Maps. But as I've been running more and participating in some longer races, I've noticed that its accuracy was starting to become questionable.]]></description>

Given that and my limited knowledge of node.js, I decided that I'd be better served moving back to WordPress as my platform since I am familiar with PHP and its inner workings.]]></description>

As you can tell, the look isn't all that different from it's previous look, but the backend is completely different.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Several months ago, when Ghost was first released to the public, I took a look at it and made a note to give it a look-see. Over the past week, I finally got it running on my dev server playing nicely with my Apache setup. So far I've been playing around with it and am contemplating whether I want to switch my blog platform over to it from WordPress, which is what I currently use.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Every year, it seems the holidays come up on me faster and faster. It really feels like it was just Halloween yesterday. Maybe it's because I was so occupied with planning my wedding this year, but it really seems like the whole year has just flown by. I guess it doesn't help that I've just been so busy this December. With everything going on, this is the first year that Lauren and I ended up getting a fake tree. I've always been far more preferential to real trees because I love their look, and their smell. The fun is also going out and finding the tree and cutting it down. The weather never really cooperated for us going to cut one down, and we realized that we just didn't have the room. On the plus side, there's less of a worry that our cat Cookie will eat the Christmas tree and get sick.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In November of 2011, after really getting into photography, I decided to finally take the plunge and get myself a DSLR camera. I chose the Canon EOS 60D because I liked what it offered, and my girlfriend (now my fiancee) also had it and recommended it to me. I should add that it also is nice since we'll be able to share lenses. Fast forward to now, I've gotten better with photography, but don't always have the time to go out with my Canon and find those awesome shots.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[About 1-2 years ago, I decided to stop development work on OpenVoter. It's still there, you can still download and use it, but it just hasn't been updated. Kind of sad too, because some updates were actually pretty far along for the next version. That said, if I ever end up going back to work on it, it might very well take a fair amount of time to figure out where exactly I left off. But going back to the time that I decided to move on from OpenVoter, I remember debating what I wanted to do somewhat heavily. I really liked what I was able to accomplish with it, but at the same time, it wasn't really used by anyone that I knew of and didn't really see it moving anywhere else. In the end, I begrudgingly decided to shelve it and find something else to work on.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There never seems to be enough hours in the day to get everything I want to done. Part of that is me failing to motivate myself to focus, the other is just me being busy. Take today for example. I meant to spend a good portion of the afternoon working on teaching myself libGDX for the game idea I have. What did I do? Get myself distracted so much I only got through a very little bit of the one tutorial I was going through. That being said, I can proudly say that it wasn't Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, or the Internet that distracted me. It was really just my lack of being able to focus that led to me getting up to go sit out on the couch with Lauren, or just roam around aimlessly. Today was not going to be my day to focus.]]></description>

I felt that DarkNemesis and Darker Nemesis just didn't really feel like 'me' anymore. So I went about trying to find a new moniker.
