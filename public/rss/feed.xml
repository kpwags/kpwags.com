            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I needed to do recently was write unit tests for one of the pages of Digital Family Cookbook where I pull a value from a query parameter in the URL. I ended up having some trouble with it so I figured I&#x27;d share what I did to get it working.</p><p>First, let&#x27;s look at the component. In the component, I&#x27;m looking to get the recipe&#x27;s ID from the URL and then query the API to get the recipe data. The URL is formatted like <code>/recipes/view/:id</code> where <code>:id</code> indicates the recipe&#x27;s ID. An actual URL would be <code>/recipes/view/25</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-typescript">import { useParams } from &#x27;react-router&#x27;;

const { id } = useParams();

const fetchRecipe = async () =&gt; {
    if (!id) {
        setErrorMessage(&#x27;Error loading recipe&#x27;);
        setPageState(PageState.Error);
        return;
    }

    const [data, error] = await Api.Get&lt;Recipe&gt;(`recipes/get?id=${id}`);

    if (error) {
        setErrorMessage(error);
        setPageState(PageState.Error);
        return;
    }

    setRecipe(data);
    setPageState(PageState.Ready);
};
</code></pre><p>In the code, I use the <code>useParams()</code> hook to get the ID and I use it in the <code>fetchRecipe()</code> function to query the API.</p><p>This worked well, but I also needed to write unit tests for this which means that I need to be able to get the ID when there isn&#x27;t a URL to pull from. Enter some Jest magic.</p><pre><code class="language-typescript">import Router from &#x27;react-router&#x27;;

jest.mock(&#x27;react-router&#x27;, () =&gt; ({
    ...jest.requireActual(&#x27;react-router&#x27;),
    useParams: jest.fn(),
}));

describe(&#x27;&lt;ViewRecipe /&gt;&#x27;, () =&gt; {
    test(&#x27;It renders the recipe&#x27;, async () =&gt; {
        jest.spyOn(Router, &#x27;useParams&#x27;).mockReturnValue({ id: &#x27;1&#x27; });

        renderWithRouter(
            &lt;MockAppProvider user={MockUserAccount}&gt;
                &lt;ViewRecipe /&gt;
            &lt;/MockAppProvider&gt;,
        );

        await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() =&gt; screen.queryByText(&#x27;Loading...&#x27;));

        expect(screen.queryByText(/Test Recipe 01/)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
});
</code></pre><p>At the top we setup the mock for <code>react-router</code>. We tell it to use the actual module, but then replace the <code>useParams()</code> hook with a mock function since we need to adjust what it returns.</p><p>In the test, we then tell jest to spy on the router component and watch for <code>useParams()</code> to be called. The spy will then pay attention to if and when it is called, and if it is, return the mocked value of <code>{ id: &#x27;1&#x27; }</code>.</p><p>Now when the <code>ViewRecipe</code> component is rendered the <code>useParams()</code> hook will return an ID of 1 for the test. The cool part about this is that we can set the spy in every test to return a different value for the test. I use <a href="https://kpwags.com/posts/2021/02/03/unit-testing-with-msw">Mock Service Worker</a> to mock my API calls, so the different ID values can trigger different data returns.</p><p>So there you go, a nice easy way to write tests when your components rely on React Router and the <code>useParams()</code> hook.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May was an eventful month. I didn&#x27;t do much because I was exposed to COVID‚Ä¶and then got COVID later in the month. Needless to say, the month could have gone better, but it could have been far worse.</p><h2>COVID</h2><p>Getting the COVID part over with‚Ä¶early in the month, my wife and I ended up getting exposed to COVID. We opted to play it safe and isolated ourselves up in the house for 3-4 days to make sure we didn&#x27;t have it or spread it to others. We never got it‚Ä¶then later in the month happened. I got it, presumably from hockey, and while I holed myself up in the basement trying to protect my wife from it, failed at that too. While certainly not pleasant, both of us are fine now and thankfully only had to deal with mild symptoms. Being vaccinated and boosted certainly helped keep us out of the hospital and alive.</p><h2>Data &amp; Office Clean-Up</h2><p>Earlier in the month I decided to delve back into Linux by putting the latest version of Fedora on my desktop to dual boot. I was hoping to extend its life a little bit, but even with Fedora, it is seemingly a little on the sluggish side. I&#x27;ll have to play around with it a little bit to see if I can figure out what&#x27;s going on. It was beneficial though because it allowed me to pull the data off my old server&#x27;s hard drives. I used to run a file server on an old desktop computer. Sadly it died and all my data was just sitting around on the hard drives. I recently bought a Synology NAS and spent the better part of a weekend pulling data off the old drives and put them onto my NAS. I have to do some organization, but at least the data is now accessible.</p><h2>Fitness News</h2><p>I also finally made the decision to run the 2022 Philadelphia Marathon. I&#x27;ve been going back and forth on it, and finally decided to run it in an attempt to run a sub-5 hour marathon. I&#x27;ll have to trim 15 minutes from my 2015 time, but I think it&#x27;s doable. Official training starts in August, but I&#x27;m gonna try to slowly up the distance prior.</p><p>I also ended up hitting new PRs on both deadlifts and squats. Managed 385 lbs. on deadlifts, and hit my 350 lbs. goal on squats. Yay me! I ended up stalling on bench press so hopefully I can get that going again in June. Want to try to hit my goals by the time marathon training kicks in.</p><h2>Stage Fright</h2><p>I volunteered to give a presentation on unit testing to my company&#x27;s development department. I was nervous as all get-out, but managed to do it. Probably could&#x27;ve done a little better, but it didn&#x27;t go bad.</p><h2>Monthly Roundup</h2><p><strong>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running &amp; Biking</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Running:</strong> Only ran a little over 23 miles this month.</li><li><strong>Biking:</strong> Nope</li></ul><p><strong>üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lifting:</strong> Ended up setting new PRs on both deadlifts (385 lbs.) &amp; squats (350 lbs.)</p><p><strong>üìö Reading:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-passion-economy-the-new-rules-for-thriving-in-the-twenty-first-century/9780804172776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Passion Economy</a> - Finished this one.

    @RecipeId INT,
    @Name VARCHAR(255),
    @Description VARCHAR(3000),
    @Source VARCHAR(255),
    @Time INT,
    @Ingredients VARCHAR(MAX),
    @Directions VARCHAR(MAX)
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE [dto].[Recipe] SET
            [Name] = @Name,
            [Description] = @Description,
            [Source] = @Source,
            [Time] = @Time,
            [Ingredients] = @Ingredients,
            [Directions] = @Directions
    WHERE
            [RecipeId] = @RecipeId
END
GO
</code></pre><p>What made this difficult was that you had to pass in each field and can&#x27;t call the stored procedure missing any parameters. Sure you could give some default values, but then your parameters&#x27; default values might overwrite values you really wanted to keep.</p><p>Now, I found a better way!</p><pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE PROCEDURE [dto].[UpdateRecipe]
    @RecipeId INT,
    @Name VARCHAR(255) = NULL,
    @Description VARCHAR(3000) = NULL,
    @Source VARCHAR(255) = NULL,
    @Time INT = NULL,
    @Ingredients VARCHAR(MAX) = NULL,
    @Directions VARCHAR(MAX) = NULL
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE [dto].[Recipe] SET
            [Name] = ISNULL(@Name, [Recipe].[Name]),
            [Description] = ISNULL(@Description, [Recipe].[Description]),
            [Source] = ISNULL(@Source, [Recipe].[Source]),
            [Time] = ISNULL(@Time, [Recipe].[Time]),
            [Ingredients] = ISNULL(@Ingredients, [Recipe].[Ingredients]),
            [Directions] = ISNULL(@Directions, [Recipe].[Directions])
    WHERE
            [RecipeId] = @RecipeId
END
GO
</code></pre><p>By having each parameter default to <em>null</em>, we can then make use of the <code>ISNULL(value, value_if_null)</code> function. For those unfamiliar, the <code>ISNULL</code> function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is the value you want to use. The function will check to see if it is <em>null</em>. If it is not null, it will return that value. If it is NULL, then it will return the second argument as the value.</p><p>What that means for the procedure is that we can now pass in any subset of parameters we need to, save for <code>RecipeId</code> (the primary key) and it will update the table leaving the values not passed to the stored procedures untouched.</p><p>The downside is that this only works with Microsoft SQL Server, but since that&#x27;s what I primarily use, it works out for me. For those using MySQL, you can still use the <code>ISNULL</code> function, but it only takes 1 argument and will return 1 (true) or 0 (false) if the value is <em>null</em>. You can add that to an IF statement, but it&#x27;s not quite as clean.</p><p>The more you write code, the more you learn!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#x27;s been almost 4 years since I got rid of my Instagram account which my last tie to the Facebook ecosystem. With the news of Elon Musk buying Twitter, I&#x27;ve rethought where my blog fits into my internet presence.</p><p>Given that I suspect Twitter might very well take a turn for the worse with Elon at the helm, it reminds me of all the cases where platforms disappeared out from under users. Some are still around as a shell of themselves, others are gone completely.</p><p>That&#x27;s one of the many beauties of having your own site. The platform is yours. It will only disappear if you want it to. You have full control over it which means you can tinker with how you display your content. You can add more forms of content, you can change how it&#x27;s displayed, the web is your oyster.</p><p>I know I&#x27;m not the only one who believes this, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/29/rss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="https://cagrimmett.com/thoughts/2022/04/26/why-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Chuck Grimmet</a> and many others feel the same way. So go out there, build your blog and control your own content.</p><p>Speaking of new content, have you checked out my new <a href="https://kpwags.com/photoblog">photo blog</a>?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April wasn&#x27;t a terribly busy month for me. I spent a lot of it just hanging around the house working on my blog and side projects.</p><p>I started the month by beating the Halo Infinite campaign. Despite the community&#x27;s lackluster view of it, I mostly enjoyed it. Parts of it reminded me of FarCry 5, others definitely had the classic Halo feel. There were definitely some repetitive parts that probably could&#x27;ve been spiced up some, and maybe made the open world part a little more open, but I still enjoyed it. The story had some holes to it, but lived up to the game&#x27;s name and left open parts for future expansions or games.</p><p>Towards the end of April, <a href="https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/04/26/there-goes-the-neighborhood">Elon Musk bought Twitter and that began me seriously reconsidering how much of my time I will spend there</a>. I haven&#x27;t made any firm decision yet, but I did use that as an excuse to clean up some things on my blog. I had noticed some bugs so I spent some time fixing them. The main one was my RSS feed. I had properly built my blog to support MDX, but my RSS feed didn&#x27;t know what to do with it and rendered custom components as if they were HTML components. You can imagine that didn&#x27;t turn out the way it should have. I got that squared away for the most part. Styling isn&#x27;t perfect in the feed, but the content is rendered properly. I might try to play around with it some in the hopes of getting feed readers to preview it better, but I&#x27;m also not sure how worth it the venture would be. I also ended up adding a font toggle in the footer to allow for users to switch between sans, serif &amp; monospaced fonts. Why? Because why not?</p><h2>Monthly Roundup</h2><p><strong>Running &amp; Biking</strong>: Still off the bike.</p><ul><li>Ran another 27 miles this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little over two years ago, the world came to a screeching halt because of COVID-19.

It&#x27;s a lot easier for me to get into a flow when I&#x27;m working on a task. I feel like there are less distractions and I can just put my head down and code. I have to be cognizant of not letting my Microsoft Teams notifications distract me too much, but other than that, I can still get my work done in a timely manner.</p><p>I don&#x27;t need to get into all the benefits as I&#x27;m sure many already know what they are. Lack of a commute as well as wear and tear on my car, ability to intermittently take care of small tasks like laundry, easier to exercise over lunch, the list goes on. I enjoy them all while still being productive. I wish more companies and managers could respect that.</p><p>I would find it hard for myself to return to an office. If I have my way, I&#x27;ll only work remotely from here on out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of drama with Elon Musk purchasing Twitter, and overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m happy with where things are likely to go on the platform.</p><p>The more I&#x27;ve learned about Elon Musk, the less I think of him. The guy is smart, there&#x27;s no doubt about that. With what he was able to do with PayPal, Tesla, &amp; SpaceX, he&#x27;d have to be. But through all of this, he&#x27;s also shown his true colors and rubbing me, and a lot of others, the wrong way to put it mildly. This is one of the reasons I am not happy with him becoming the person in charge of Twitter.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, he&#x27;s spoken out about how he&#x27;s upset with how Twitter handles their moderation. He&#x27;s seemingly upset that Twitter labeled a few of his tweets as <em>false</em> and that they&#x27;re too restrictive on speech. He says he views himself as a free speech absolutist and has been using this to go after Twitter for how they handle speech on their platform.</p><p>I am all for freedom of speech, I believe that people should be free to express themselves. I also believe that while people are free to say whatever the hell pops into their mind, that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t consequences for said speech. If someone comes to you and starts spewing the most racist garbage you&#x27;ve ever heard, you&#x27;re welcome to tell them to get lost and kick them out of your social events.</p><p>Twitter, like all platforms, has the right to moderate the content on their site as they see fit. If you don&#x27;t like it you can <del>migrate to another platform</del> buy the platform...wait...ummm... Well, I guess that&#x27;s what I may very well end up doing, I&#x27;ve already become a little more active on Mastodon. That&#x27;s the power of capitalism. If you don&#x27;t like a product, switch to another or build your own. People have been upset with Facebook and Twitter for a long while now, accusing it of being biased against conservatism (spoiler alert, that&#x27;s not the case at all). It&#x27;s why we have platforms like Gab, Gettr, Parler and Trump&#x27;s own Truth Social. The fact that they&#x27;re generally filled with racist, misogynistic assholes should say all that needs to be said.</p><p>The concern however is how Elon&#x27;s freedom of speech absolutism will show itself on Twitter. There has been a long history across just about every platform you can name of having to deal with people representing the worst of humanity. Twitter has had plenty of issues with dealing with this in the past, and they certainly have had their share of screw-ups, but it seems like they&#x27;ve recently been doing a decent job of striking a decent balance. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/26/twitters-legal-team-has-been-an-aggressive-defender-of-free-speech-will-that-continue-under-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Twitter has even been one of the most aggressive defenders of free speech</a>.</p><p>My concern is that Elon&#x27;s going to relax the rules, and we&#x27;re going to be left with a platform that supports more disinformation and one that allows for even more hate and harassment. I&#x27;m a straight white man and am hardly even noticed on Twitter or any social media platform for that matter. I don&#x27;t have to deal with a lot of the garbage that goes on behind the scenes for others. But I know that others are far more vulnerable and are constantly dealing with threats and harassment online from others, and from bots. Hell it&#x27;s pretty common knowledge that if you criticize Elon Musk or Tesla online, his fanboys and their bots will deluge you with hate. Is he going to consider that free speech? It&#x27;s one thing to disagree with someone, it&#x27;s another to harass and threaten them to the point where they are worried for their life.</p><p>Let&#x27;s face it, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/11/20/masnicks-impossibility-theorem-content-moderation-scale-is-impossible-to-do-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Content moderation is hard</a>, especially at scale. It&#x27;s something the best and brightest have been trying to handle for over a decade. It&#x27;s not an easy thing to accomplish and so far, no one really has.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that Elon himself has no problem trying to silence critics. He&#x27;ll even go so far as to  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/elon-musk-blogger-tesla-motors-model-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">personally cancel people&#x27;s orders</a> if they criticize him. I guess some people&#x27;s speech don&#x27;t matter much. It makes you wonder if he&#x27;d use his position to go after his critics on Twitter. I wonder if <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/03/19/rep-devin-nunes-sues-internet-cow-saying-mean-things-about-him-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Devin Nunes&#x27; Cow would have something to say</a> given what the internet bovine had to deal with.</p><p>Maybe Elon has some better ideas for Twitter. I&#x27;m very skeptical of that, but maybe. The fact that Twitter will no longer be publicly traded might help insofar as they won&#x27;t have to deal with maximizing shareholder value every quarter. But others did help fund Musk&#x27;s buyout so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re going to want to see a return on their investment. His comments on bringing transparency to the algorithm might be beneficial. There might be some upsides, but right now I don&#x27;t see them outweighing the other questionable things Musk has said and complained about Twitter.</p><p>Twitter, and to a lesser extent, Reddit were really the only social media platforms I frequent. I ditched all of Facebook years ago and have mostly just hung out on Twitter. This change has made me start re-thinking that. I&#x27;ll probably peruse Mastodon some (come <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/@kpwags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">follow me</a>), but I think I&#x27;m going to start focusing more on maybe writing and sharing here on my blog. I also went and updated my RSS feeds, so maybe I&#x27;ll start to stay away from algorithmic viewing and go back to 2008 with blogs and Google Reader (RIP). On a side note, if you have a good blog and wanna share your RSS feed, by all means let me know.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March didn&#x27;t particularly feel like that busy of a month. About the only eventful thing that happened was a week-long vacation to Cape May, New Jersey at the end of the month.</p><h2>Homebrew Results</h2><p>I can proudly say that both the Belgian Blonde and the Red Ale I brewed both turned out fantasic. The red ale has a great malt taste to it and the blonde has a nice sweetness to it. I was worried about both since it can be too easy to contaminate a brew, but both ended up delicious.</p><h2>Morning Brew</h2><p>This month, I started grinding my own coffee right before brewing it. I picked up an <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07CSKGLMM?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a> that we keep right next to the coffee pot. I figure it will allow my wife and I to try new beans and flavors.</p><h2>Continued Work on Digital Family Cookbook</h2><p>I put my fitness tracking app on the back burner for the time being and have moved onto re-writing Digital Family Cookbook in .NET and a brand new React/TypeScript frontend. My big win this month was getting integration tests running succesfully. I ended up using Entity Framework for it, so I can use an In-Memory database to run the tests. It&#x27;s pretty neat...at least to me.</p><h2>Monthly Roundup</h2><p><strong>Running &amp; Biking</strong>: Still cold out which limited me to some extent</p><ul><li>Between sore legs and rain, I only ended up running 25 miles</li><li>Didn&#x27;t end up biking any...the stationary trainer I have is kind of boring to me so I have to be in the mood</li></ul><p><strong>Lifting</strong>: I ended up setting a new PR for squats, but my deadlift is stalling a bit.</p><ul><li>squats (335 lbs.)</li></ul><p><strong>Reading</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/nudge-the-final-edition/9780143137009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nudge</a> - This was a fantastic read into how we as humans can be persuaded into doing things in ways we don&#x27;t always recognize.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February felt like a busy month, it seemed like every weekend we had something going on keeping us moving about.</p><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/02/04/january-check-in">January Check-In</a>, I ended up brewing not just the one beer, but ended up brewing a second beer, an all-grain beer as well. The first beer was an extract brew, a Belgian Blonde, which is currently bottled and waiting for it to be ready to crack open. The second was an all-grain brew, my first attempt at an all-grain batch which I decided to go with a Red Ale. I was hoping to have it ready for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, but it&#x27;s still fermenting so it will likely be a few days late...oh well. The hardest part is waiting to find out how they turned out. They could be fantastic...or they could be ruined. I won&#x27;t know until I crack open the first bottle.</p><p>I also started a bullet journal. I had been using Notion to keep track of things, but I decided I liked the idea of going more analog and using a Moleskine notebook.</p><p>I&#x27;m also trying to find a nice balance for myself with keeping up with the news. At the end of the month, Putin decided to invade Ukraine so the firehose of all the horrors going on has left me trying to stay informed while not feeling all gloom and doom all of the time.</p><p>I ended up really just spending a lot of evenings on the couch with my wife watching our TV shows. It really is the perfect way to wind down.</p><h2>Monthly Roundup</h2><p><strong>Running &amp; Biking</strong>: Still cold out which limited me to some extent</p><ul><li>Ran another 43 miles this month</li><li>Didn&#x27;t end up biking any...the stationary trainer I have is kind of boring to me so I have to be in the mood</li></ul><p><strong>Lifting</strong>: I ended up setting two new PRs...I&#x27;m now 92.5% of the way to the 1,000 lbs. club!</p><ul><li>deadlifts (375 lbs.)</li><li>squats (325 lbs.)</li></ul><p><strong>Reading</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-apollo-murders-9781668601075/9780316264532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Apollo Murders</a> - I enjoyed this book. It had a good story that pulled you in. As a space fan, I definitely enjoyed the tie-ins with the Apollo program. The ending wasn&#x27;t my favorite part, but it did tidy up the story arcs. Would still recommend it to anyone.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing</strong>: Wrote my first technical post of the year.</p><ul><li>Wrote about <a href="https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/02/19/setting-up-github-actions-on-net-projects">setting up GitHub Actions for a .NET project</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Gaming</strong> - Continued my Halo series play-through.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/halo-the-master-chief-collection/9ntm9hxnlszx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Halo 3</a> - I have obviously already played the heck out of this game, but played through it again for my Halo series play-through.</li><li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/halo-the-master-chief-collection/9ntm9hxnlszx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Halo 3: ODST</a> - This is the only Halo shooter I never beat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing Git Actions at work at my job, I decided that I wanted to see what I could do for my personal projects with GitHub Actions.</p><p>At work in order for our PRs to be completed, our code needs to match our ESLint guidelines and our unit tests need to pass. I like those rules so I wanted to apply them to my personal projects on GitHub. I knew GitHub had the ability to do the same thing so I sat down and taught myself how to set them up. A little while later, I was able to get them up and running and am quite happy with the results so I figured I‚Äôd share how I did it.</p><h2>Some Background</h2><p>I set this up for my re-write of <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/digital-family-cookbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Digital Family Cookbook in .NET</a>. I have my backend broken up into 3 projects.</p><ol><li>The Web API (DigitalFamilyCookbook)</li><li>A ‚ÄúCore‚Äù Class Library (DigitalFamilyCookbook.Core)</li><li>A ‚ÄúData‚Äù Class Library (Digital Family Cookbook.Data)</li></ol><p>I have a separate .NET Unit Test project for the Web API and the core class library. One for the data class library will be added soon. Because of this, I ended up creating two actions, one to run the API unit tests, and a second to run the core library unit tests.</p><h3>Step 1: Create the Workflows Folder</h3><p>In your root directory create a folder named <code>.github</code> and inside that folder create a folder named <code>workflows</code>.</p><h3>Step 2: Create an Action</h3><p>Create a file called <code>unittests.yml</code></p><h3>Step 3: Build the Action</h3><p>Start by giving the action a name</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: DigitalFamilyCookbook Unit Tests
</code></pre><p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We want each action to have a name that is descriptive of what the action does.</p><p>Next, we want to define when we want the action to be run.</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]
</code></pre><p>This tells GitHub that we want these actions run when we push code to the main branch (I don&#x27;t really do this, but put it here anyway), or when a pull request is submitted against the main branch.</p><p>Finally, we want to set up the action itself.</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Setup .NET
              uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
              with:
                  dotnet-version: 6.0.x
            - name: Restore dependencies
              run: dotnet restore
              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests
            - name: Build
              run: dotnet build --no-restore
              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests
            - name: Test
              run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal
              working-directory: ./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests
</code></pre><p>Let&#x27;s look at how this is structured.</p><ol><li>We tell GitHub to run this on the latest version of Ubuntu.</li><li>Next, we define the steps to take to run the action. Each bullet point is basically a step in the process<ol><li><code>uses: actions/checkout@v2</code> is the official GitHub action that will checkout the code in order to run the actions we define</li><li><code>name: Setup .NET</code> is the name of this step which we use the official GitHub action to setup .NET for the action, specifying we want to use .NET 6. This is important as I am taking advantage of some of the new .NET 6 functionality that will break on previous versions.</li><li><code>name: Restore dependencies</code> is where we tell the action to install the project&#x27;s dependencies. you can see the next line defines the actual command. Just like we&#x27;d do in the terminal on our own machine. We tell the action to run <code>dotnet restore</code> The final part is to specify the directory to run this command in. Since I&#x27;m running the tests for the API project, we specify it as <code>./backend/tests/DigitalFamilyCookbook.Tests</code> which is the path from the root of the repository to where the <code>.csproj</code> defining the unit test project lies.</li><li><code>name: Build</code> is where we tell the action to build the project, again just like we&#x27;d do in our terminal. Again, we need to specify the working folder.</li><li><code>name: Test</code> is where the butter is at. This tells us to run the test command to execute our unit tests. Like the <code>restore</code> and <code>build</code> steps, we also need to specify the working folder here as well.</li></ol></li></ol><h3>Final Result</h3><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: DigitalFamilyCookbook Unit Tests

on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Setup .NET
              uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1

</code></pre><p>That&#x27;s it. It was not nearly as difficult to setup as I initially thought. Now whenever I open a pull request, it will run the unit tests and make sure they pass before I can complete it and merge it with the main branch. I ended up creating a second action file and run the same steps, only with the <code>DigitalFamilyCookbook.Core.Tests</code> project.</p><h2>Bonus: Run the React Unit Tests Too!</h2><p>As an added bonus, I&#x27;ll add how I set up the action to run Jest for the frontend unit tests.</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Front End Unit Tests

on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        strategy:
            matrix:
                node-version: [15.x]

        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
              uses: actions/setup-node@v1
              with:
                  node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
            - run: npm install
              working-directory: ./frontend
            - run: npm run test
              working-directory: ./frontend
</code></pre><p>It&#x27;s very similar to the .NET actions, only in this case we specify the node version instead of .NET, and run the npm commands in the frontend directory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s already February. It feels like January just came and went.</p><p>January as a whole wasn&#x27;t a super busy month. The biggest thing that happened was me taking an all-grain brewing class at the end of the month. Over the course of the last several years I&#x27;ve been brewing beer at home as a hobby, but I&#x27;ve been limited to extract brewing. It can turn out some good brews, but I know there is so much more I can do moving beyond extract and mashing the grains myself. I was hoping to learn how to do it before the pandemic, and when my local homebrew shop was offering a class, I signed right up. It was a good class and I am now itching to try my hand at an all-grain brew. I‚Äôm planning on brewing this weekend but it will be one more extract brew before I try my hand at some more advanced recipes.</p><p>Other than that, not much to really report so far.</p><h3><strong>Monthly Roundup</strong></h3><p><strong>Running &amp; Biking:</strong> Ran 43 miles and biked 9 in January. Braved the cold quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Reading:</strong> Finished <strong><em>Leviathan Falls</em></strong>, and with it, <em>The Expanse</em> series.</p><p><strong>Writing:</strong> Wrote about the <a href="https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/01/19/books-i-read-in-2021">books I read in 2021</a> and my new <a href="https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/01/25/tracking-my-2022-goals">2022 goals page</a>.</p><p><strong>Gaming:</strong> Continued my play-through of the Halo series. Beat Halo 2 and started Halo 3. Also picked up a PS5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I figured I‚Äôd build a little something to help keep me accountable.</p><p>You can view this <a href="https://kpwags.com/progress/2022">new page</a> where you can see the goals I‚Äôve set and the progress I‚Äôm currently at. The lifting goals are a little weird as it looks like I‚Äôm already almost there. I can say with absolute certainty though that getting that little bit more will be harder than it may seem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well 2021 was quite the year...it started with a failed coup by the GOP, a wide rollout of a life-saving COVID-19 vaccine that almost half the country doesn&#x27;t want to take because they&#x27;re being lied to by their (vaccinated) political leaders and news channels, and we&#x27;re back in another COVID-19 wave entering the third year of the pandemic...so all in all...just peachy.</p><p>Now that that part is over with, my 2021 wasn&#x27;t awful. I ended up getting my vaccination in March &amp; April, so that by the beginning of May I was ready to cautiously re-enter the world to at least a certain degree. I still wear my mask while out and about, even before Omicron entered the equation, but it&#x27;s nice to feel comfortable visiting family and having the occasional dinner out. It also means I&#x27;m back at the ice rink playing hockey. So to make a long story short, a small bit of normalcy has returned.</p><h3>General Overview of 2021</h3><p>At the end of last year, I started a new job at Webstaurant and a year in I&#x27;m still enjoying working there. I feel like I&#x27;m learning a great deal and am able to work with new technologies to keep my development chops growing and fresh.</p><p>I ended up redesigning and rebuilding my blog using React &amp; Next.js which was fun. I&#x27;d been toying with the idea of moving away from Jekyll for a little while and when I was starting to have problems getting it to play nicely with my new M1 MacBook Pro, I decided to take the plunge. I still want to write about my experience porting it over and re-writing it so hopefully I&#x27;ll get to that soon.</p><p>With regards to vacations, I ended up taking three trips this year. I spent a week in September in Cape May for our yearly vacation. We were able to check out some breweries and wineries and just relax. In October we went back to Cape May for a long weekend for our anniversary, and in November we visited New York City so Lauren could see Hamilton and we could have some fun.</p><p>In December, we unfortunately had to say goodbye to the bestest boy, Otto. It was an unfortunate way to enter the holidays and end the year, and it still fucking sucks.</p><h2>Looking Back at 2021</h2><p>Last year I didn&#x27;t really set any tangible goals, I just wanted to focus on certain things.</p><h3>Staying Active</h3><p>This one I felt I did pretty well with. I was able to focus primarily on my lifting while getting in plenty of runs and some walks as well. Starting in May I was able to get back into hockey so I had another outlet to keep active. My diet got better towards the end of the year as well so I&#x27;m starting to see a downward trend that I hope I can continue.</p><h3>Improving My Development Knowledge</h3><p>I&#x27;ve ended up making tremendous progress on my fitness tracking app. There&#x27;s still a lot to go and a lot to smooth out, but I feel like I have a good framework in place. This is one area where what I&#x27;m learning to do at work has been helping me improve at home.</p><p>My blog re-write and the setup I&#x27;m starting to look at for a .NET re-write of Digital Family Cookbook is challenging me as well.</p><h3>Continuing to Read</h3><p>This didn&#x27;t go as well as I had hoped. I only ended up reading 9 books this year.</p><h3>Write More</h3><p>I&#x27;m not sure this went badly, but I&#x27;m not sure it went great either. I ended up writing 21 posts this year which was more than 2020, but am not sure that they were as substantive as I would have liked.</p><h2>Setting Goals for 2022</h2><p>Since I&#x27;m hoping that 2022 will continue our trek towards normalcy and hopefully a better headspace, I want to set some actual goals for myself.</p><h3>Goal #1: Run More &amp; Start Biking More</h3><p>In 2020, I ended up running over 800 miles. That was spurred by a 175 day running streak and a good period of time where running was the only exercise I felt comfortable doing given the pandemic. In 2021 I started out biking on my bike trainer and getting some runs in. A month or two in, the biking stopped and the runs weren&#x27;t as consistent as I would have liked while I focused on lifting. I did end up hitting 325 miles on the year which still isn&#x27;t too shabby. I&#x27;m going to target running 400 miles and biking 500 miles this year. I&#x27;ve been toying with running the Philadelphia Marathon this year to hopefully break the 5-hour mark, so if I end up attempting that, the 400 miles might be easy to hit. The 500 miles on the bike could potentially be a challenge to fit in with everything else, but also feel it&#x27;s doable.</p><h3>Goal #2: Bench Press, Squat &amp; Deadlift PRs</h3><p>This year I&#x27;m hoping to set more PRs on the 3 of the 4 big lifts. I want to break a 400 lbs. deadlift, a 350 lbs. squat, and a 250 lbs. bench press. I&#x27;m at 360, 310 &amp; 215 respectively so while it&#x27;s a stretch, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s outside the realm of possibilities.</p><h3>Goal #3: Max Out My Retirement Accounts</h3><p>Over the last several years, I&#x27;ve been really focusing on improving where I stand with regards to retirement. Last year I was able to max out my Roth IRA and I&#x27;m hoping to do that again this year while also hopefully maxing out my 401k at work as well.</p><h3>Goal #4: Read 30 Books</h3><p>My goal this year is to read at least 30 books, with at least 15 of them being non-fiction. Not to knock fiction and novels, but I want to have a good balance.</p><h3>Goal #5: Write 10 Technical Blog Posts</h3><p>Writing monthly wraps and other posts are fine, but I want at least 10 posts in 2022 to be focused on software development and have some substance to them. I&#x27;m hoping by just getting started it will spur the writing to continue.</p><hr/><p>So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to accomplish this year. I think all 5 of them are doable. Some could certainly pose a real challenge, but I guess that&#x27;s part of the point.</p><p>Here&#x27;s to a good 2022!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December was a rough month.</p><h2>Mr. Otto</h2><p>Despite the good start for December, the month was a rough one. A week before Christmas, Otto had a relapse. The fluid had built up around his heart again and his vitals took a pretty bad turn. They could&#x27;ve drained the fluid again, but it would have been hard on Otto and was only a band-aid for the larger issue of the (now certain) tumor on his heart. There wasn&#x27;t much more we could do for him and still give him a good quality of life, so Lauren and I made the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to him. Needless to say, it put a huge damper on the holidays. Even now after 3 weeks the house still feels empty. It still hurts and it fucking sucks.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMjgwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Otto in the hallway smiling" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Otto in the hallway smiling" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2022-01-05-december-check-in%2Fotto.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2022-01-05-december-check-in%2Fotto.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2022-01-05-december-check-in%2Fotto.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><h2>Busy with Work</h2><p>The project I was working on since I started my job at Webstaurant a year ago went live the week leading up to Christmas. Needless to say it was all hands on deck to work out the various kinks and bugs that we weren&#x27;t able to catch in QA or didn&#x27;t have the right data to find in QA. There were a bunch of late evenings working, but things are going well with it now. Despite the seemingly weird time to do a product launch, there were good reasons to do it then and things ended up working out.</p><h2>The Holidays</h2><p>With Otto weighing heavily on our minds, we did our best to still celebrate the holidays. Lauren and I were able to do our Christmas Eve Seafood Dinner this year and hosted her side of the family Christmas Day. We were able to enjoy ourselves which a week earlier I wouldn&#x27;t have thought as possible.</p><p>We were supposed to go up to see my family Sunday, but unfortunately my brother tested positive for COVID, so we opted to stay home instead. We&#x27;re hoping to see them this weekend.</p><h2>Starting Over with Halo</h2><p>Halo Infinite came out December 8th, but instead of jumping right in, I&#x27;ve opted to re-play through the series in story order. I&#x27;m currently on Halo 2 after playing through Reach and Combat Evolved. I&#x27;m planning on playing right through until I get to Infinite while trying to avoid spoilers.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p><strong>Staying Active:</strong> Had plenty of hockey this month, one team made it to the finals and lost in the shootout. Lifting, I set a new PR on deadlifts at 360 lbs. I also ran more miles this month than I had in any month this year and was able to break my goal of 300 miles for 2021!</p><p><strong>Development:</strong> Have made some progress in the next phase of my fitness tracker project. Also spent some time laying out a .NET Core re-write of Digital Family Cookbook.</p><p><strong>Reading:</strong></p><ul><li>Finished <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-righteous-mind-why-good-people-are-divided-by-politics-and-religion-9798200560639/9780307455772">The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion</a></em> by Jonathan Haidt<em>.</em> It was a dense read, but was interesting.</li></ul><p><strong>Write More:</strong> Other than my November Recap, nada.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November was a rather quiet month all things considered.</p><p>The month started out a lot quieter than September or October. A few hockey games here and there, but otherwise it was just my normal <a href="/posts/2021/01/14/my-typical-weekday">nothing-out-of-the-ordinary</a> days.</p><h2>New York City</h2><p>Mid-November that changed with a long weekend visiting New York City.

We ended up going over to Bryant Park for the Christmas Village. We went over to Queens to check out some of the local breweries. Overall it was just an enjoyable trip. It was nice to be able to go to events there and know that they were checking vaccination status. Made me feel safer to be out and about.</p><h2>Killing Spree!</h2><p>After getting back, I was greeted by being able to download the Halo: Infinite multiplayer beta. It definitely brought me back to my late college and early post-college days of playing Halo 3 online with friends. The game has been a lot of fun. I&#x27;m still getting back into it, but I&#x27;m definitely enjoying it. If you&#x27;re playing, let me know and maybe we can hop on and play a few rounds. I&#x27;m annoyed at how 343 is handling the customizations in terms of having to pay for just about everything, but it&#x27;s not pay-to-win, so it&#x27;s not an absolutely huge deal to me. The gameplay is fun. I&#x27;m looking forward to playing the campaign, but am kind of bummed that co-op doesn&#x27;t come out until May(ish) 2022.</p><h2>Mr. Otto</h2><p>Sadly, the month ended on a little bit of a down note. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving we had to take our dog Otto to the emergency vet and found out (surprisingly) that there was fluid build-up around his heart which was preventing his heart from beating properly. Thankfully they were able to drain it and he&#x27;s back to his old self, but we now need to find out what caused the build-up. Hemangiosarcoma seemed to be the worst-case scenario, but thankfully that&#x27;s pretty much now ruled out. There still could be a tumor, so we&#x27;re going to have to bring him back in for more tests. It was just tough leaving him in the hospital overnight and then having to wait throughout the day Thanksgiving for updates. He&#x27;s home now and happy as ever so if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I&#x27;m gonna go give him some lovin&#x27;.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p><strong>Staying Active:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t too much hockey this month. 2 of my teams are now down to 2 games a month. Was able to get a bunch of runs in and have continued progressing with my lifts.</p><p><strong>Development:</strong> Have made some progress in the next phase of my fitness tracker project. Hoping to devote some time over the month to get this next feature set in place.</p><p><strong>Reading:</strong></p><ul><li>Finished <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-buyout-of-america-how-private-equity-is-destroying-jobs-and-killing-the-american-economy/9781591843696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Buyout of America</a> by Josh Kosman.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October felt like it was a busy month. It seemed that we had plans every weekend and were always on the move. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily a <em>bad</em> busy, but it probably foreshadows the upcoming holiday season.</p><p>I&#x27;ve decided to stick with using Notion as a platform and have moved a bunch of my notes and organizing into it. I&#x27;ve been sticking with my daily journaling on it keeping track of what I want to do and what I&#x27;ve done each day. Life gets busy and sometimes it&#x27;s a nice way to look back and remember what happened when life&#x27;s happenings start to blur together.</p><p>The month started out with us celebrating my Mom&#x27;s birthday with a Lehigh Football Game and dinner at my sister&#x27;s. The football game wasn&#x27;t all that much fun to watch as it ended up being a 34-0 blowout, but the weather was beautiful and we had good company.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNDQwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="The Lehigh Football team taking the snap deep in their own zone" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="The Lehigh Football team taking the snap deep in their own zone" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-11-17-october-check-in%2Flehighgame.jpeg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-11-17-october-check-in%2Flehighgame.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-11-17-october-check-in%2Flehighgame.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>In mid-October, after attending my cousin&#x27;s wedding, Lauren and I went to Cape May, NJ again, this time celebrating our 8th anniversary.

I‚Äôve always appreciated Tim‚Äôs take on a multitude of topics so his recommendation had my interest piqued.</p><p>The book‚Äôs primary focus is to make the reader think about their opinions and consider how they form their opinions and what it might take to reconsider them. For plenty of people, including myself, what we think we know may or may not be as much as we actually know. (See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dunning‚ÄìKruger Effect</a>)</p><p>Being able to re-consider one‚Äôs viewpoints is a definitively good mindset to be in. All too often we form our opinions, get set in our filter bubbles, and refuse to change our minds. I know I can be guilty of this myself. I like to think the world works a certain way, and will sometimes need some extra prodding to revisit where I stand.</p><p>I think all too often we have our minds set on why people are the way they are, or that a certain group of people are <em>[insert adjective here]</em>. I know it‚Äôs grown even harder over the last 6 years given the current political climate. Democrats hate Republicans, Republicans hate Democrats. The polarization has become seemingly extreme as of late. The pandemic certainly hasn‚Äôt helped matters either. I know I sometimes have to take a step back and think about those who have chosen not to get vaccinated. I know there are those who are fervently anti-vaxx, thinking it‚Äôs some kind of liberal conspiracy or whatever the hell they‚Äôre believing these days. But then I take a step back, read some more, and see that there are others who are unsure for a multitude of reasons. Some understandable, some questionable, but not at the level of the QAnon folks. It‚Äôs kind of ironic that I read this while the pandemic is going on as one part of the book talks about doctors trying to figure out how to best handle those not wanting to have their children get the childhood vaccines (think MMR, Polio, etc.). As the book mentions, sometimes it‚Äôs just doing your best to listen to each other rather than talking down to them. Sure, there are plenty you won‚Äôt be able to reason with, but maybe, just maybe there are others you can help re-think their views.</p><p>The other thing that I often think about is how it&#x27;s often seen as a weakness to change your mind on things. In politics, politicians who change their views are so often called flip-floppers. It doesn‚Äôt matter why they changed their view, or how long it took them. They changed their view, so they can‚Äôt be trusted. It‚Äôs a shame too, because there are countless good reasons to change or adjust your view.</p><p>Looking back at my life, I think the biggest ‚Äúshock‚Äù for me was going to college. I grew up in the suburbs of Allentown, Pennsylvania. I was raised in a decidedly middle-class household. I was fortunate and never had to worry about how life‚Äôs necessities were going to be taken care of. The people I met in high school were very much the same.</p><p>Going to college, and given Drexel&#x27;s location in Philadelphia, all of a sudden I was introduced to people from wildly different backgrounds. Some who came from more money than I‚Äôd know what to do with, others who had to scratch and claw for everything. It opened my eyes to what others had to deal with and made me re-think about how lucky I was and that maybe I should reconsider my thoughts about others who may not have had the benefits I had growing up.</p><p>It falls back to science as well. I mean think about the scientific method. The way scientists work is they come up with a hypothesis, test it, and adjust their hypothesis accordingly. It&#x27;s a little bit more complicated than that, but it‚Äôs ultimately the gist of it. Scientists follow the science and will generally adjust their views based on the results of their scientific inquiry. I forget where I read it, but I remember reading somewhere that good scientists are willing to recognize when they are wrong just as fervently as when they are right. Changing your mind or re-thinking something as the situation changes shouldn‚Äôt be considered a weakness, but rather a strength. There&#x27;s a maturity to be able to say you were wrong.</p><p>At the end of the day, I really believe that this is generally a good mindset to have. We all obviously have our convictions and views we strongly believe in. But to be willing to hear and listen to the other side or other alternate viewpoints will hopefully make us better people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September seemed to fly by pretty quickly, but it was definitely a good month. I enjoyed a week away on vacation and felt like I got a lot accomplished.</p><p>Month started off well and I was feeling very productive. It helped that hockey has been on a slight hiatus so I was able to spend more nights at home. I used that time to finish up my blog redesign. I actually just got it deployed and switched over. I&#x27;m now using <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> to host it and the setup process was pretty easy once I got the kinks ironed out.</p><p>Towards the end of August, I started using <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> for notes. I&#x27;m still not entirely sure how I like it, but the one thing I&#x27;ve started doing it creating new journal notes every day tracking what I would like to do, what I did, and links to some of the more interesting things I&#x27;ve read. Even if I end up moving back to my synched Dropbox folder with Markdown Files, I think I&#x27;m going to continue this.</p><p>In mid-September, my wife and I went to Cape May for a week on vacation. We rented a condo on the beach and took a nice week away to do basically nothing. Well, maybe not quite nothing, but it was a much needed break. We ended up visiting several breweries and wineries, and were able to meet up with my parents one afternoon for lunch and some beers. I brought several books hoping to read some while there, but I ended up working on my fitness tracker side project far more than I had planned. It worked out because I was able to get quite a bit done on it. There&#x27;s still a ways to go, but progress is progress. Yes, I spent a bunch of time programming, but Lauren and I were able to spend the week the way we wanted, so I count that as a fantastic vacation. It was nice to come back home and sleep in my own bed again though.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNDQwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="The Jersey Shore in Cape May" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="The Jersey Shore in Cape May" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-10-06-september-check-in%2Fcape-may.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-10-06-september-check-in%2Fcape-may.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-10-06-september-check-in%2Fcape-may.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>While I didn&#x27;t end up finishing a single book while on vacation, I did finish <em>Think Again</em> by Adam Grant shortly after getting home.

I&#x27;ve run more miles in September than in any month this year April.</p><p><strong>Development:</strong> Finished up most of my blog re-write. Made good progress on my fitness tracker. And not to muddy the waters, but have started putzing around with moving Digital Family Cookbook over to .NET Core.</p><p><strong>Reading:</strong> I finished <em>Think Again</em> by Adam Grant and also was able to go through my Pocket list and read a bunch of articles I&#x27;ve marked for read later.</p><p><strong>Write More:</strong> I wrote one post on my thoughts about <a href="https://kpwags.com/2021/09/04/on-software-subscriptions.html">software subscriptions</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that has started to bug me of late is that it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to simply &quot;buy&quot; software. I mean we&#x27;ve always been at the mercy of companies with their license agreements and sometimes DRM, but now it&#x27;s starting to feel even worse.</p><p>If you go back ten years and you wanted the latest version of Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, or just about any other piece of paid software, it was simple. You went online or to the store and you purchased it. You got the installer either digitally or on CD/DVD, probably a license key and you installed it.</p><p>Nowadays, so many pieces of software require you to purchase a subscription in order to use it. Photoshop &amp; Lightroom can&#x27;t be purchased standalone, you have to buy an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription for $10/month. Office is pushing people towards purchasing an Office 365 subscription instead of a standalone copy. Now apps on Apple&#x27;s App Store and Google Play are getting in on the action. Now, no longer are you allowed to pay $5 for an app, now you have to pay $5/month to have all the features of the app.</p><p>I write about this as I&#x27;m planning on getting back into my photography and am trying to decide how I want to handle my collection. I bought Adobe Lightroom 5 a while back (back when it was brand new which probably shows how long ago that was), but have since switched to using the $10/month Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop Bundle. Now that my old MacBook Pro bit the dust and I&#x27;m starting fresh on my new M1 MacBook Pro, I&#x27;m trying to decide if the $10/month is really worth it for how much I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use it. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong; Lightroom &amp; Photoshop are fantastic pieces of software. They&#x27;re incredibly powerful, and do what they were designed to do fantastically well. The issue stems from having to pay for them in perpetuity.</p><p>Now I want to say unequivocally that I have absolutely no issue in paying for software. I&#x27;m a developer so I understand what it takes to build software and I believe that companies and developers should get paid. My problem with this model is that I can&#x27;t simply buy the latest version of Lightroom or whatever other app or software I&#x27;m looking at. Like others, in the case of Lightroom, Adobe no longer sells Lightroom. All they sell is the subscription to <strong><em>USE</em></strong> it. Cancel your subscription, cancel your ability to use the software.</p><p>A previous example of this is the app I used to use on my Mac, iPhone &amp; iPad. Airmail was my favorite email app for the longest time. It provided a bunch of useful extra features that I enjoyed. I paid for the app on both my iOS devices &amp; my Mac. Then all of a sudden, they jumped to a subscription-only model. If I wanted to continue using the app to its full capabilities (including notifications), I would have to start paying for a subscription. I was bummed, and that was the last time I used the app. I opted to go back to the default iOS &amp; Mac Mail apps. It annoyed me. I paid for the app and it felt like they were playing a bait and switch game. I paid for certain features and all of a sudden they pulled those features away from me. If they had released a new version and required me to pay for the new version with the new features, I would have been much more understanding. At that point, I would simply look at the new features they were offering and see if they were worth the additional money to me. If they were, I would have paid the money and bought the new version. Again, I&#x27;m not against paying for new versions or even new functionality. In Airmail&#x27;s case, I was even more angry because they took away functionality that I felt that I paid for.</p><p>I think another reason why I feel a little peeved about this is that in some of these cases, I feel like there&#x27;s not a reason for a subscription outside of a money grab. Again, take Adobe Lightroom &amp; Photoshop as an example. I can&#x27;t see any reason why someone shouldn&#x27;t be able to be able to simply buy the software to use. There&#x27;s no real reason why it needs to be subscription only. They offer Adobe Creative Cloud and cloud storage as part of the bundle, and if that was what they were charging for, so be it. But I don&#x27;t use their cloud storage. I already pay for Dropbox for my cloud storage and I don&#x27;t really need any of Adobe&#x27;s sync functionality. Let me simply pay for the software and if I decide I do want the cloud offerings, I&#x27;ll gladly pay for them. With Lightroom, I was able to find an old installer download, so I&#x27;ll soon find out if it still works. If it does, great! If it doesn&#x27;t, I think I&#x27;ll give <a href="https://darkroom.co/">Darkroom</a> a try.</p><p>I guess what a lot of this boils down to is that I miss simply buying the software I use and not having to pay a subscription for it. I&#x27;m also worried that this will start to become more and more normal to the point where all of a sudden Windows 12 becomes subscription-only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I posted about how I was tweaking my workout to a <a href="/2021/01/28/tweaking-my-lifting-routine.html">6 day program</a>. That routine worked well for me, but then hockey started back up and I wasn&#x27;t able to keep up. A new routine was in order, and I chose to build one based on <a href="https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big">Jim Wendler&#x27;s 5/3/1 BBB (Boring But Big)</a> program.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been running it for a couple months and I&#x27;m seeing some decent progress. I&#x27;m approaching my pre-pandemic weights on bench, squats &amp; deadlifts. I&#x27;ve also set a new PR on overhead press at 155 lbs. (I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is 1:1 as I was doing standing overhead press, but now I have to do seated overhead press at home since my basement ceiling isn&#x27;t tall enough). That said, I never hit 155 standing so I&#x27;ll take it.</p><p>It&#x27;s definitely similar to how I was running my 6 day program, but it forces me to move up a little faster than I was in the past, which is good. It focuses on the 4 main lifts (overhead press, deadlift, bench press, &amp; squats) and runs on 4 week cycles. It again uses my 1 rep max (1RM) to calculate my training max (TM) (90% of my 1RM) which then calculates the weights I lift.</p><p>For each of the main lifts, the sets are set up like.</p><p><strong>Week 1:</strong></p><ol><li>5 reps at 65% of my TM</li><li>5 reps at 75% of my TM</li><li>5+ reps at 85% of my TM</li><li>5 sets of 10 reps at 50% of my TM</li></ol><p><strong>Week 2:</strong></p><ol><li>3 reps at 70% of my TM</li><li>3 reps at 80% of my TM</li><li>3+ reps at 90% of my TM</li><li>5 sets of 10 reps at 55% of my TM</li></ol><p><strong>Week 3:</strong></p><ol><li>5 reps at 75% of my TM</li><li>3 reps at 85% of my TM</li><li>1+ reps at 95% of my TM</li><li>5 set of 10 reps at 60% of my TM</li></ol><p><strong>Week 4:</strong></p><p>Deload. I basically just do the lifts at 50-60% intensity to give my muscles a break.</p><p>I then up my 1RM for deadlifts &amp; squats by 10 lbs., and the 1RM for overhead press and bench press by 5 lbs., rinse, and repeat.</p><p>The one thing I&#x27;ve been noticing on with squats and bench press is I feel like my brain is holding me back. There seems to be some kind of psychological component to it. Unlike the gym, I don&#x27;t have access to a spotter so there&#x27;s part of me that gets a little scared about the weights I&#x27;m lifting. I do have safety bars that will protect me for both lifts, but I always managed to lift heavier when I know someone is there to help if I start to go the wrong direction. Failure is a part of lifting and I have no shame in saying I&#x27;ve failed lifts on a multitude of occasions, but it&#x27;s still scary when you have 200+ lbs. on your back or over your chest.</p><p>But even with the psychogical aspect of the heavy weights, one of the reasons I like the program is how it has me moving up in weights. The progress is slow, but it&#x27;s steady. I&#x27;m obviously not setting PRs every week, or even every other week, but I see and feel progress while limiting the &quot;scare&quot; factor.</p><p>Anyway, here&#x27;s the routine I&#x27;m running.</p><h3>Day 1 - Overhead Press</h3><ol><li>Overhead Press</li><li>Upright Row - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Skullcrushers - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Front Raise - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Dumbbell Face Pulls - 3 sets of 15</li><li>EZ Bar Curls - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Pull Ups - As many as I can do</li></ol><h3>Day 2 - Deadlift</h3><ol><li>Deadlifts</li><li>Front Squat - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Standing Barbell Calf Raises - 3 sets of 12-15</li><li>Russian Twists</li><li>Ab Wheel</li></ol><h3>Day 3 - Bench Press</h3><ol><li>Bench Press</li><li>Bent Over Barbell Row - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Incline Bench Press - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Hammer Curls - 3 sets of 12</li><li>Single-Arm Dumbell Tricep Extensions - 3 sets of 12</li><li>Dumbbell Face Pulls - 3 sets of 15</li><li>Chin Ups - As many as I can do</li></ol><h3>Day 4 - Squat</h3><ol><li>Squats</li><li>Romanian Deadlifts - 3 sets of 10-12</li><li>Standing Barbell Calf Raises - 3 sets of 12-15</li><li>Dumbbell Side Bends - 3 sets of 15</li><li>Ab Wheel</li></ol><hr/><p>What&#x27;s your routine, any lifts you swear by?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#x27;t believe how fast we&#x27;ve gotten through the first half of 2021. It feels like despite the slow start, the year has just flown by. I figured I&#x27;d take a look back and see how I&#x27;m doing with what I&#x27;ve been doing this year, and how I&#x27;ve been faring with what I was hoping to focus on this year.</p><h2>What I&#x27;ve Been Up To</h2><h3>Playing Hockey Again</h3><p>Until May, I wasn&#x27;t fully vaccinated, so I opted to play it safe and limit my excursions outside the house. Now that I&#x27;m fully vaccinated, I&#x27;ve started to go back out into the world. This includes playing hockey again.</p><p>I&#x27;m back to playing on the team I&#x27;m captain of. And I&#x27;m playing in the lower league as well. Sadly, I ended up losing my goalie spot as there are only 8 teams, so only 8 goalie positions. I am able to skate out with a good group of guys and girls so I&#x27;m still able to get more time on the ice. I&#x27;m on the sub list so I&#x27;m still able to play in net now and again. I&#x27;m hoping a spot will open up in the fall season so that I can start playing goalie again full time. I played in a tournament this past weekend as the netminder and had a lot of fun. Four games in three days made my legs a little unhappy...followed by a fifth game the next day, but it was totally worth it. I&#x27;m now playing hockey one or two times a week, and I&#x27;m happy to be back on the ice.</p><h3>House Projects</h3><p>The biggest project on my house was re-doing the kitchen cabinets. Our kitchen cabinets&#x27; paint was looking a little run down, and in some cases peeling, so we opted to sand them all down, re-paint them, and install new hardware. It was a lot of hard work, a bunch of cursing at various things, but the end result turned out great. The cabinets aren&#x27;t anything to ooooh and ahhhh over, but they look a lot nicer and will hold off a needed kitchen remodel for the time being.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNDQwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="The end result of the kitchen cabinets refinishing" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="The end result of the kitchen cabinets refinishing" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-07-24-halfway-through-2021%2Fkitchen.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-07-24-halfway-through-2021%2Fkitchen.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-07-24-halfway-through-2021%2Fkitchen.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>I also ended up putting in a raised flower bed around one of our street lights.

(The joys of home ownership)</p><h2>Looking at My Focus Points</h2><h3>Staying Active</h3><p>I&#x27;ve been pretty good with this one. I haven&#x27;t been running nearly as much as I was planning, but I&#x27;m back to playing hockey and am continuing to strength train, so all&#x27;s well on the active front. Diet needs work, but that&#x27;s always the case. I&#x27;ll get there I hope.</p><h3>Improving My Development Skills</h3><p>I feel like this one is going really well. Between work and my side project, I&#x27;m learning new ways of doing things and becoming more proficient in React &amp; TypeScript. Outside of the <a href="/2021/06/02/refactoring-loops.html">refactoring loops</a>, I like where I am at with my never-ending coding journey. I&#x27;m trying to strike a balanace between also continuing forward with my <a href="/2021/04/27/switching-platforms.html">blog rewrite</a>. I&#x27;m also going back and forth with how much I want to redesign my blog while rewriting it.</p><h3>Reading More</h3><p>I could be doing better here. Between late nights with hockey, video games, and other things, I haven&#x27;t spent as much time reading as I would like.</p><h3>Writing More</h3><p>I&#x27;m not unhappy with where I am, but I could definitely be writing more. I have some ideas for some posts, so I suppose I should buckle down and start writing them.</p><hr/><p>Let&#x27;s finish out 2021 strong.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I wasn‚Äôt alive for Nixon &amp; Watergate, and was too young to remember much of the details of the Bill Clinton impeachment so both seasons filled in a lot of the blanks for me.</p><p>The latest season, season 5, focuses on the run up to the Iraq War. I was in my freshman year of college when the US invaded Iraq in March 2013. I was old enough to know more of what happened in the run up and after the invasion. Despite that, this podcast has given me some more insight into what all happened from 2001 to 2003 when Bush started the War in Iraq.</p><p>I‚Äôd highly recommend checking it out.</p><p><a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/slow-burn/s5/road-to-the-iraq-war">Slow Burn: The Road to the Iraq War</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever feel like you can never completely get started with a project? That&#x27;s sometimes how it feels with the fitness tracking app I&#x27;m building.</p><p>But despite all this, I feel like I&#x27;m farther along than I was a month or two ago even without any new functionality added. How is that possible you ask? Well it really comes down to refactoring my code.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjU2MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNzA0IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Computer Code" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Computer Code" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-06-02-refactoring-loops%2Fcode.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-06-02-refactoring-loops%2Fcode.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><h2>First, a Little Background</h2><p>I haven&#x27;t been seriously building apps in React for all that long. The first real app I built was Digital Family Cookbook. I was able to build it thanks to a course from Wes Bos on React &amp; GraphQL. My issue was that I didn&#x27;t have a firm enough grasp with React and Node.js to really build what I wanted to. While definitely functional, Digital Family Cookbook is a little rough around the edges. Everything works, but it doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;smooth feel&quot; one would come to expect from an app of its kind. At this point, I have the project on an indefinite hold as I try to decide what to do with it.</p><h2>Taking Steps Forward</h2><p>I wanted this new fitness app to be better. I wanted to make sure I had a better grasp of how everything pieces together to make an app that is much more smooth in action. This is one of the reasons I chose a .NET Core backend. I&#x27;ve been a .NET developer almost exclusively in all my jobs. And with how powerful and versatile .NET Core has become, it felt like a great option. No disrespect to Node, but I just feel more comfortable in the .NET ecosystem.</p><p>I&#x27;ve also read a lot more into React as well to give me a better foundation. The only wildcard that I&#x27;ve really thrown in is introducing myself to TypeScript. I think I&#x27;ve gotten a good grasp on it now though. I feel like my knowledge of Javascript has put me in a good place.</p><h2>Developing the App</h2><p>From the beginning, I&#x27;ve felt much better about the architecture of the app. The backend isn&#x27;t much of an issue as I have good understanding of C# and .NET. I&#x27;ve picked up on the new features of .NET Core pretty easily as well.</p><p>I also started a new job at Webstaurant Store back in December. At Webstaurant Store, we have been using .NET Core, React, &amp; TypeScript. I have some great teammates and have been learning a great deal about these frameworks as well as some new tips and tricks with how to improve my code. In 5 short months I&#x27;ve already felt like I&#x27;ve improved with all of these tools tremendously. I&#x27;ve also been trying to read more blogs and other articles from fellow developers to try to get a better idea of how others do things.</p><p>This has had its benefits, but it is also a double-edged sword. Looking at my experiences at Webstaurant Store and what I&#x27;ve been reading, I&#x27;ve ended up looking at the code I&#x27;ve written, only to realize that I can make it better. Needless to say, this has put me in a place where I end up in a constant refactoring loop.</p><blockquote><p>Don&#x27;t Let Perfect Be the Enemy of Good</p></blockquote><p>I&#x27;ve heard this expression several times, &quot;Don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of good&quot;. And it makes sense. Apps will never be perfect. Code will never be perfect. Don&#x27;t wait to achieve perfection because you&#x27;ll never end up reaching it. At some point, you have to have to recognize that it&#x27;s good enough. So far with this project, I haven&#x27;t exactly followed this advice so far. I&#x27;ve been focusing on trying to make sure that I have as good a foundation to build the app as possible. It&#x27;s led to two major refactors that have basically caused me to have introduced no new functionality.</p><h3>Entity Framework to Dapper</h3><p>The first thing I ended up re-writing was moving the code away from Entity Framework over to <a href="https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper">Dapper</a>. This required me adjusting not only the backend C# code, but also writing Stored Procedures to interact with the database. I could&#x27;ve done a lot of it with inline SQL, but I generally feel like stored procedures are the way to go for most calls to the database. I made this switch because I felt like I could get slightly better performance through Dapper and hand-written SQL, and to get myself more familiar with the libraries I would be using at my new job. It might not have been the best reasoning, but I&#x27;m happy where things are. I have a database folder with all the creation scripts that should help me build the database quickly if and when it&#x27;s needed. I do kind of miss the Entity Framework migrations though.</p><p>I might be jumping ahead of myself, but I&#x27;m toying with using EF6 if I opt to rewrite Digital Family Cookbook in .NET.</p><h3>Custom Components to Formik &amp; Material-UI</h3><p>While switching to Dapper took a chunk of time, it was by no means the biggest. I had been unhappy with how some of the forms were working. I was seeing some of the roughness I experienced with Digital Family Cookbook. Not to the same level, but enough that I decided it would be worth it to look into some form libraries rather than my custom built forms. I settled on <a href="https://formik.org/">Formik</a>. The conversion was going so well, I decided I&#x27;d also look into a full UI framework rather than rolling my own. &quot;In for a penny, in for a pound&quot; the expression goes. I decided to switch to using the <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material-UI Framework</a>. I ended up spending several weeks converting all the pages I had built to use Material-UI rather than the homecooked components. Thankfully I had only build out the settings pages so there wasn&#x27;t a ton I had to redo, but you can see where this refactoring loop comes into play.</p><h2>Onward</h2><p>While it has certainly been less-than-ideal to be sort of running in place in terms of functionality, the changes that I made turned out well. I feel more confident in this app&#x27;s foundation and the ability to add the new functionality on top of it.</p><p>Are there still things I need to improve? Of course there are...there always are. I just have to keep reminding myself that I can always come back to it later if it&#x27;s working well. Just because it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;, doesn&#x27;t mean I shouldn&#x27;t try to continue to make it better. It just means that I can move onto what&#x27;s next.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;ve been using Jekyll to run this blog for the better part of the last six years. But recently, I&#x27;ve been giving serious consideration to switching to Gatsby or Next.js.</p><p>I have several reasons for making the move away from Jekyll. Some is pure personal preference, some involves the technology used, and part of it is to learn something new.</p><h2>Missing Features &amp; Personal Preference</h2><p>There are several features I&#x27;ve been wanting to add to my blog. The biggest one is probably search. I&#x27;ve been looking into adding search, and while possible, doesn&#x27;t seem as easy as I would hope it to be. Part of this also comes down to the fact the Jekyll is built on Ruby, which is not a language I know all that well. I&#x27;ve been able to keep this going, but it&#x27;s still a hill to climb. This is the personal preference part of things. I&#x27;m a .NET &amp; Javascript developer primarily, and that&#x27;s where my comfort zone is. It&#x27;s not a knock on Ruby, just not something I want to spend a lot of time delving into.</p><h2>The Tech Stack</h2><p>I also wanted to move to a stack I better understood. I&#x27;ve been working with React for a couple years on the side, and now I&#x27;m using it professionally as well. I thought it would be beneficial and easier to work with if I had a better understanding of the tools &amp; language used.</p><p>Another thing I was looking into improving was my build/deployment process. I host my blog on AWS using their S3 storage. The upside is that hosting is dirt cheap for me (granted there&#x27;s very little processing power for my site, nor do I have many visitors). The downside is that there&#x27;s a lot of caching involved so any changes can take a day or so to be reflected. There are ways around this of course, but I&#x27;m a little cost-conscious and am worried about racking up too large a bill. This can also cause any embarassing bugs or typos (or anything else really) to be visible for much longer than I&#x27;d like.</p><h2>Making the Switch</h2><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjA3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEyNCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img alt="Next.js Logo" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Next.js Logo" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-04-27-switching-platforms%2Fnextjs.svg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-04-27-switching-platforms%2Fnextjs.svg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-04-27-switching-platforms%2Fnextjs.svg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>I&#x27;ve given it a fair amount of thought and right now I believe I will be starting the design and implementation of my blog using Next.js. I used Next.js with <a href="https://advancedreact.com/">Wes Bos&#x27; Advanced React &amp; GraphQL Course</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/digitalfamilycookbook">Digital Family Cookbook</a> so I have some familiarity with it over Gatsby. But while I have some familiarity with it, it wasn&#x27;t heavily used in either project so I figure this will also be a learning project.</p><h2>The Process</h2><p>I plan on building this out in the open and will be starting with a <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/new.kpwags.com">brand new public repository on GitHub</a>. I&#x27;m going to build it using feature branches (like I&#x27;ve been doing with my fitness tracker) with issues created for most work. Unlike my current blog where I mostly just work off of the main branch, I&#x27;ll be doing this one the &quot;proper&quot; way. I&#x27;m even planning on keeping at it with future posts.</p><p>I&#x27;m also hoping to write about how things are going and the progress I&#x27;m making as well as why I&#x27;ve chosen doing things the way I do. I&#x27;ve also been toying with streaming some of the development on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kpwags">Twitch</a>.</p><p>There&#x27;s no rush to build this, so while I&#x27;m going to try to devote some time on it regularly, I also want to continue to work on my fitness tracker. So keep checking back as I&#x27;m sure there will be more posts between now and when I officially make the switch.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s already April, it really seems like it was just New Year&#x27;s yesterday. Alas, I figured I&#x27;d check in with how I&#x27;m doing with my goals.</p><h2>Staying Active</h2><p>I&#x27;ve been doing a good job staying active. I&#x27;m lifting 5-6 days a week, I&#x27;m running more now that the weather&#x27;s gettiing a little nicer. I feel generally pretty good about my activity level. My issue is that I struggle with the willpower to lay off the snacking. Now that I&#x27;m working from home, it&#x27;s a little too easy to just munch on things here and there. I&#x27;m a little disappointed in myself sometimes, but I also do my best to remember that it&#x27;s also not that big of a deal. I&#x27;m hoping to focus this month on trying to stick within my calorie goals.</p><h2>Improving My Development Chops</h2><p>I&#x27;m continuing to learn both at work, and at home. I&#x27;m continuing work on my fitness tracker app. It&#x27;s development is taking a little bit of a roundabout, which I&#x27;m currently writing a post to explain. The important thing is that I&#x27;m making progress and generally feeling accomplished with what I&#x27;m producing.</p><h2>Continuing to Read</h2><p>I&#x27;m on my fifth book of the year and have mixed in keeping up with my <em>Economist</em> subscription, so I&#x27;m happy with where I&#x27;m at. It&#x27;s nice getting into bed a little early, winding down reading before going to sleep.</p><h2>Write More</h2><p>I&#x27;ll chalk this up as a mixed bag. I have a whole bunch of post ideas and some started. I just need to actually take the time to sit down and write them up. A lot of them are more in-depth than posts like this one.</p><h2>Everything Else</h2><p>I ended up getting my first COVID-19 shot mid-March. I am getting my second this weekend &amp; my wife is next week, so I&#x27;m happy to really see the beginning of the end of this thing. Hopefully more people can line up appointments and get the shot. I&#x27;m also hoping I&#x27;ll be able to start playing hockey again soon too.</p><p>I also ended up re-doing my office this past week. I switched from an ultrawide monitor to dual 27&quot; 4k monitors. I have to say I like the extra screen real estate. I ended up moving my ultrawide downstairs to use for work. Since both my wife and I work from home and regularly have calls, I ended up creating a second office in my basement for work so that we&#x27;re not interfering with each other. An added benefit of this setup is that it gives me some separation between &quot;home&quot; and &quot;work&quot;. When I&#x27;m downstairs, I&#x27;m working; when I&#x27;m upstairs, I am on my own time.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMTY3IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="My new desk setup with dual 27&#x27;&#x27; 4k monitors" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="My new desk setup with dual 27&#x27;&#x27; 4k monitors" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-04-06-three-months-down-in-2021%2Fdesksetup.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-04-06-three-months-down-in-2021%2Fdesksetup.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2021-04-06-three-months-down-in-2021%2Fdesksetup.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>My wife and I have now also started to re-do the kitchen cabinets. It&#x27;s a smaller home improvement project, but we&#x27;re taking the cabinet doors off, sanding and re-painting everything, and installing new hardware. It&#x27;s not exactly HGTV-worthy, but it should spruce the kitchen up a little bit until we get around to redoing it entirely.</p><hr/><p>Still not much to report, but figured I&#x27;d post this to help keep myself accountable. Stay safe out there!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;m currently reading <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/field-of-schemes-how-the-great-stadium-swindle-turns-public-money-into-private-profit-revised/9780803260160">Field of Schemes</a> by Neil Demause &amp; Joanna Cagan. It talks about how sports team owners manage to screw the public out of money to pay for their new stadiums and arenas. In one of the later chapters, I found a quote that I think sums up how absurd it is that we are the ones paying for their stadiums.</p><p>For reference, &#x27;TIFS&#x27; stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_increment_financing">Tax Increment Financing</a>. The short description is it&#x27;s just a finance tool that is often used to make things like stadium deals seem less toxic and more palatable.</p><blockquote><p>As St. Paul Pioneer Press columnist Edward Lotterman wrote on the absurdities of TIFS: &quot;My wife and I have often talked about a small addition that would extend the back porch the full width of the house. It would be nice if the government would give us the money to do this. The value of the house would increase and so would our taxes. The higher taxes would pay the government back eventually, so it wouldn&#x27;t cost taxpayers anything. It seems like a great idea, but for some reason the government is not willing to step up to our plate. We threatened to move to Portland or Charlotte if we don&#x27;t get help, but officials just laughed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I&#x27;m a big sports fan, and a fan of the Philadelphia teams, especially the Flyers and the Phillies. Still, I would rather see them pack up and leave than spend public funding on new stadiums. That money could be better spent on schools, public transit, and countless other initiatives that would bring a much better return on investment to Philadelphia than a new stadium ever could.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#x27;t quite decide if this year is flying by...or dragging on...and on...and on.</p><p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure why it feels like time has slowed down. The pandemic is still gripping the nation, I&#x27;m still stuck in quarantine with my wife. Nothing has really changed for me from say September of last year to now. The only big difference is that it&#x27;s not as fun to be outside right now with the cold and all the snow. Seriously, I think I&#x27;ve used my snowblower more this year than in the previous 5 years I&#x27;ve owned my house combined. But not wanting to be outside doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s the reason this year feels like it&#x27;s been dragging. The weather doesn&#x27;t normally affect me like this, so I&#x27;m guessing the pandemic and everything that goes along with it is finally starting to get to me.</p><p>As rough as it&#x27;s felt though, it hasn&#x27;t been an awful year. I&#x27;ve been doing a good job at sticking with my 2021 goals. I&#x27;ve been enjoying and thriving at my new job. I&#x27;ve been able to enjoy weekends and evenings with my wife. All in all, it&#x27;s been a good two months so far.</p><h2>Staying Active</h2><p>I&#x27;ve been doing a good job of staying active around 6 days a week. My primary activity is lifting, but I&#x27;ve also been bringing out my bike trainer I got for Christmas a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve been hesitant with the cold, snow and ice to run. The last thing I want to do is slip, fall and twist my ankle (or worse). The bike trainer gives me the ability to get my heart rate up and get a cardio workout in to supplement my lifting.</p><h2>Improving My Development Chops</h2><p>I can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s been a lot to say here. I&#x27;m learning a lot at my new job and am continuing on with my fitness tracker project, so I&#x27;m going to count that as a continued success.</p><h2>Reading More</h2><p>Again, not much to say here, I&#x27;m on my fourth book of the year. Haven&#x27;t always felt like reading books every night, but I have done a better job at keeping up with my RSS feeds.</p><h2>Wrtiting More</h2><p>I feel like I&#x27;ve done a little better with this. Two months in, I have almost half the number of posts I had in 2020. I think I&#x27;ll be able to keep this up.</p><hr/><p>All in all, there&#x27;s not much to report. I&#x27;m just gonna keep doing my thing and hoping that I will be eligible for the COVID vaccine sooner than I figure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last couple weeks, I&#x27;ve made some small improvements to my site. None of them are particularly huge, but I like the end result.</p><h2>Adjusted the Header</h2><p>I decided to change up the header a little bit. The header isn&#x27;t horribly different from before, but now I decided to make it span the full width of the browser window. I also added a link to the RSS feed since I feel that&#x27;s an important feature in today&#x27;s web. It might have fallen out of favor in some circles, but I still love it. I also moved the light/dark mode switcher from the footer to the header and made it a little more descriptive with a sun and moon icon.</p><h2>Adjusted the Footer</h2><p>I also decided to adjust the footer, re-laying out the links and allowing it to fill the full browser window.</p><h2>Removed SASS</h2><p>SASS came pre-bundled with Jekyll so when I built the original version of my blog, it made sense to just go with it. Since then, CSS has gotten official variable support as well as a whole bunch of other nice features, so I decided to swap it out with plain old CSS. The conversion wasn&#x27;t too bad and I feel like I was able to clean up the CSS some in the process, particularly with the light and dark mode.</p><p>CSS variables just make applying a light/dark theme so simple</p><pre><code class="language-css">:root {
    --font-family: &#x27;Maven Pro&#x27;, &#x27;Segoe UI&#x27;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    --background: #ededed;
    --background-image: url(&#x27;/assets/images/background.png&#x27;);
    --font-color: #444444;
    --blue-medium: rgb(6, 44, 156);
    --blue: hsl(215.9, 100%, 40%);
    --box-shadow: 0 12px 24px 0 hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2);
    --dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 40%);
    --review-border-color: var(--blue);
    --svg-display-lightmode: inline;
    --svg-display-darkmode: none;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    :root {
        --background: hsl(0, 0%, 13.3%);
        --background-image: none;
        --font-color: hsl(0, 0%, 93.7%);
        --blue-medium: hsl(209.1, 78.5%, 43.7%);
        --blue: hsl(199, 98.3%, 45.9%);
        --review-border-color: rgb(239, 239, 239);
        --svg-display-lightmode: none;
        --svg-display-darkmode: inline;
    }
}
</code></pre><h2>Changed the Light/Dark Mode Toggle</h2><p>Besides the switch itself, I also changed how I handle overriding the system&#x27;s theme. The CSS variables definitely helped with this, although I have an item on my to-do list to see if I can&#x27;t improve this a little more. If you&#x27;re a user who overrides your system theme, there might be a momentary flash of the system theme before your override takes effect. It&#x27;s still an option though so I feel like that&#x27;s a plus.</p><h2>Started Working with SVGs</h2><p>SVGs were something that I only recently started looking at. I decided to go with SVGs for both the theme switch and the RSS icon at the top. Learning <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> as well as how to integrate it into the page was a fun challenge.</p><h2>My &#x27;Likes&#x27; Page</h2><p>I used to run weekly posts with links I&#x27;ve liked. I&#x27;ve decided to take a page from <a href="https://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> and simply add a page that lists recent articles, podcasts, or anything else that catches my eye. I liked his idea of using his Feedbin starred feed, but felt like I might as well make it manually as I find things elsewhere that I&#x27;d want to include. You can veiw this on my <a href="https://kpwags.com/likes">Likes page</a>.</p><h2>Updated Bookshelf &amp; Movies</h2><p>My <a href="https://kpwags.com/bookshelf">reading list &amp; bookshelf</a>, as well as my <a href="https://kpwags.com/movies">movies</a> used very similar code to render. I opted to condense the JS that handles them as well as the CSS to make the pages easier to manage. I also ended up shrinking the images and expanding the width some to allow more content to be viewed at once.</p><hr/><p>I generally like how my blog looks so I didn&#x27;t go hog-wild, but it was nice to &quot;freshen&quot; it up a bit. I have a few more things I&#x27;m thinking of doing, but let me know what you think so far.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back, I started a new project. I have been using <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/01/21/tracking-my-fitness-journey.html">spreadsheets to track a lot of my fitness goals</a>. This approach generally works, but I thought it would be easier if I had an app for that. So I did what any self-respecting fitness enthusiast developer would do...make one myself! But with that, also come unit tests.</p><p>There are a whole bunch of options out there to track this stuff, but not all of them do everything, and they don&#x27;t do what I think works for me. I also figured that I&#x27;m a developer and I could build myself something that works for what I&#x27;m looking for. I was also itching to try out Typescript &amp; React, as well as the .NET Core Web API.</p><p>Not to get too in the weeds, but with this project, I wanted to do unit testing as I develop rather than at the end like I did with Digital Family Cookbook. The one thing I realized that I needed to do was be able to mock the API calls on the frontend. I stumbled upon a great post by Kent C. Dodds talking about how we <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch">shouldn&#x27;t be mocking window.fetch</a>. In it, he talks about <a href="https://github.com/mswjs/msw">MSW</a>, short for Mock Service Worker and how we can use that to intercept and mock our data calls.</p><p>I decided to give it a try and I have to say that I&#x27;m seriously impressed with how easy it is to setup and use. I figured I&#x27;d spend a little bit of time here going through how to quickly set it up and how to use it.</p><h2>Install</h2><pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install msw --save-dev
</code></pre><p>or</p><pre><code class="language-bash">$ yarn add msw --dev
</code></pre><h2>Setup</h2><p>I have a folder in my <strong><code>/src</code></strong> directory called <strong><code>test</code></strong> that holds my basic testing configuration. You can put these files in a different directory if you have your project laid out differently, but the handlers and the server setup are how your fetch calls get handled for your unit tests.</p><h3>Create Your Handlers</h3><p>MSW works by having a list of handlers that handle the various different fetch calls. You specify the endpoint and when window.fetch calls the endpoint, instead of interacting with your API, it interacts with the mock server.</p><h4><code>/src/test/server-handlers.ts</code></h4><pre><code class="language-js">import { rest } from &#x27;msw&#x27;;

const handlers = [
    // retrieve a user by their ID
    rest.get(&#x27;*/users/getuserbyid&#x27;, (req, res, ctx) =&gt; {
        const id = req.url.searchParams.get(&#x27;id&#x27;);

        if (id) {
            const userId = parseInt(id, 10);

            if (userId &gt; 0) {
                return res(
                    ctx.status(200),
                    ctx.json({
                        id: userId,
                        name: &#x27;Keith Wagner&#x27;,
                        email: &#x27;keith@kpwags.com&#x27;,
                    }),
                );
            }
        }

        return res(
            ctx.status(400),
            ctx.json({ message: &#x27;User does not exist&#x27; })
        );
    },

    // save a user
    rest.post(&#x27;*/users/saveuser&#x27;, (_, res, ctx) =&gt;
        res(
            ctx.status(200),
            ctx.json({
                successful: true,
                user: {
                    id: 1,
                    name: &#x27;Keith Wagner&#x27;,
                    email: &#x27;keith@kpwags.com&#x27;,
                },
            }),
        ),
    ),
];

export { handlers };
</code></pre><p>Let&#x27;s take a look at this code. This is where you specify how each endpoint will respond to the API call.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the first handler where I&#x27;m getting a user by their ID. My React component might need to handle a situation where the user being looked up doesn&#x27;t exist. In this case, I can add some logic in the handler to return an error in this case when the ID is less than zero. That way I can test how the component handles an unknown user by passing in a negative number (or zero), while returning the user&#x27;s info for other requests.</p><p>Not all handlers need to be as complex. If you look at the second item where I&#x27;m saving a user, you&#x27;ll see that I don&#x27;t have any logic around the request, I just send back a success message. Depending on what you&#x27;re testing, you might not need to do any additional handling of requests and responses.</p><p>Just make sure to add a handler for every fetch call.</p><h3>Setup Your Server</h3><h4><code>/src/test/server.ts</code></h4><pre><code class="language-js">import { setupServer } from &#x27;msw/node&#x27;;
import { handlers } from &#x27;./server-handlers&#x27;;

// create the server object by passing in your handlers
const server = setupServer(...handlers);

export { server };
</code></pre><p>This code sets up your server by passing in the handlers you created above and passing them as an argument to the setupServer object from MSW.</p><h3>Setup Your Tests</h3><h4><code>/src/setupTests.ts</code></h4><pre><code class="language-js">import { server } from &#x27;./test/server&#x27;;

beforeAll(() =&gt; {
    // start up the server
    server.listen({
        onUnhandledRequest(req) {
            console.error(&#x27;Found an unhandled %s request to %s&#x27;, req.method, req.url.href);
        },
    });
});

afterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers());

afterAll(() =&gt; server.close());
</code></pre><p>This code imports your mock server and tells it to start listening before running any tests, and then resets the handlers and closes the mock server when testing is complete.</p><p>When starting the server in the <strong><code>beforeAll</code></strong> function, I like to pass in the <strong><code>onUnhandledRequest</code></strong> argument. I sometimes forget about calls to the API when writing the tests, so if a window.fetch call is made that I don&#x27;t handle, it will output an error message to the console letting me know what call was made so I can go back in and handle it. It&#x27;s not necessary, but I&#x27;ve found it useful now and again.</p><h3>Telling Jest About MSW</h3><h4><code>/jest.config.js</code></h4><pre><code class="language-js">module.exports = {
    setupFilesAfterEnv: [&#x27;./src/setupTests.ts&#x27;],
};
</code></pre><p>Jest needs to know that MSW exists so that it can start the listener. In the setupFilesAfterEnv array, make sure to add the <strong><code>/src/setupTests.ts</code></strong> file.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>This is basically all there is to the setup. Anytime your frontend makes a fetch call, instead of going to the actual endpoint, it will instead go to your mock server. For me this makes this portion of testing easy as I can worry about unit-testing the API separately and focus primarily on the components and frontend. MSW makes configuring the handlers is simple and easy while still providing you the ability to handle edge case and error logic as needed. I would highly recommend giving it a try.</p><h2>One Last Thought</h2><p>One other cool thing about MSW is that you can also use it for development as well as testing. I can&#x27;t really attest to it as I don&#x27;t use it for this use case, but MSW allows you to setup a service worker to handle your requests as you develop. If you don&#x27;t have access to your backend locally or don&#x27;t want to play around with your database for whatever reason, you can <a href="https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/integrate/browser">set it up</a> to play the backend for your development work as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking back at the last two months, I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve done a pretty good job of hitting the weights 5-6 days a week. Because of this, I decided I&#x27;d tweak my routine a little bit to help jumpstart some gains.</p><p>Since I <a href="/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html">built my home gym</a>, I&#x27;ve been running a 4 day version of a 5/3/1 plan mixed with the <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout">PHUL</a> plan. This has generally worked out well for me. I was able to regain a decent chunk of the strength I lost. Now that I&#x27;m lifting around 6 days a week, I figured I&#x27;d add 2 more days worth of lifting to my cycle to hopefully help make more gains easier.</p><p>I thought I&#x27;d share the routine I&#x27;ve built myself in hopes that maybe it&#x27;ll help inspire you or give you ideas on how to improve or build yours.</p><h2>Some Terminology and Background</h2><p>I base the weights of the 4 big lifts (Overhead Press, Bench Press, Squat &amp; Deadlift) off of what they call the &quot;Training Max&quot; or TM. This is basically 90% of your 1 rep max (1RM), which refers to the heaviest weight that you can do a single rep of the exercise. So when I say &quot;5 @ 75%&quot;, that means I am doing 5 reps at 75% of my Training Max. So if my TM is 100 lbs., I&#x27;d be doing 5 reps at 75 lbs.</p><p>You&#x27;ll also notice for Mondays through Thursdays, I start with the big lift 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, &amp; 1+ @ 95%. That final &#x27;1+&#x27; set is the key set. That&#x27;s what determines when I increase my TM. If I can do at least 5 reps at 95% of my TM, then I bump up my TM by 5 lbs. Some people only use 3 as the cutoff, but I prefer 5...it&#x27;s a personal choice.</p><p>The other notations should be self explanatory. &quot;3 x 8-12&quot; means 3 sets of 8-12 reps.</p><h2>The Routine</h2><h3>Mondays - Overhead Press</h3><ol><li><strong>Overhead Press</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li><li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li><li><strong>Barbell Row</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Front Dumbbell Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li><li><strong>Barbell Shrug</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>EZ Bar Curl</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Skullcrusher</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Twenty-Ones</strong>: 1 x Narrow Grip, 1 x Wide Grip, 1 x Reverse Grip</li></ol><h3>Tuesdays - Deadlift</h3><ol><li><strong>Deadlift</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li><li><strong>Squat</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li><li><strong>Romanian Deadlift</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Standing Calf Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li><li><strong>Russian Twist</strong>: 4 x 15-20</li><li><strong>Ab Wheel</strong>: 4 x 10+</li></ol><h3>Wednesdays - Bench Press</h3><ol><li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li><li><strong>Overhead Press</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li><li><strong>Dumbbell Row</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li><li><strong>Dumbbell Bench Press</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li><li><strong>Hammer Curl</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Dumbbell Fly</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Overhead Tricep EZ Bar Extension</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Twenty-Ones</strong>: 1 x Narrow Grip, 1 x Wide Grip, 1 x Reverse Grip</li></ol><h3>Thursdays - Squat</h3><ol><li><strong>Squat</strong>: 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, 1+ @ 95%</li><li><strong>Deadlift</strong>: 5 x 10 @ 60%</li><li><strong>Front Squat</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Seated Calf Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li><li><strong>Dumbbell Side Bends</strong>: 4 x 15-20</li><li><strong>Ab Wheel</strong>: 4 x 10+</li></ol><h3>Fridays - Upper Body</h3><ol><li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: 4 x 6 @ 75%</li><li><strong>Overhead Dumbbell Press</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Close-Grip Bench Press</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Upright Row</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Zottman Curl</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Dumbbell Tricep Extension</strong>: 4 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Timed Farmer Carries</strong>: 3x</li><li><strong>Twenty-Ones</strong>: 1 x Narrow Grip, 1 x Wide Grip, 1 x Reverse Grip</li></ol><h3>Saturdays - Lower Body</h3><ol><li><strong>Squat</strong>: 4 x 6 @ 75%</li><li><strong>Sumo Deadlift</strong>: 4 x 6 @ 75%</li><li><strong>Bulgarian Split Squat</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Hip Thrust</strong>: 3 x 8-12</li><li><strong>Seated Calf Raise</strong>: 4 x 10-12</li><li><strong>Russian Twist</strong>: 4 x 15-20</li><li><strong>Ab Wheel</strong>: 4 x 10+</li></ol><p><em>Edit (2/1/21 7:13pm): Typos</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;ve seen posts like this going around so I figured I&#x27;d share what my typical weekday looks like.</p><ul><li><strong>5:45am:</strong> Wake up. Feed the cat, take the dog out and feed him. Weigh myself and get ready to workout.</li><li><strong>6:15am - 7:30am:</strong> Work out. Most often, this is lifting weights, but I might hop on my bike trainer instead from time-to-time.</li><li><strong>7:30am:</strong> Make coffee, take a shower and brush my teeth.</li><li><strong>8:00am:</strong> Start work. I&#x27;ve only been at my current job a little over a month, so meetings tend to be all over the place.</li><li><strong>12:00pm:</strong> Go for a walk, a short run or the bike trainer when I can. Have a quick bite to eat after.</li><li><strong>1:00pm:</strong> Back to work for the afternoon.</li><li><strong>5:00pm:</strong> The work day is over. I&#x27;ll generally cook dinner around now. If it&#x27;s leftovers, I might play a video game or mess around for a little bit.</li><li><strong>6:00pm:</strong> Eat dinner with my wife and then feed the animals their dinner.</li><li><strong>6:30pm:</strong> Start enjoying the evening. I&#x27;ll generally laze about. Sometimes I&#x27;ll watch some TV, play some video games or work on my side projects.</li><li><strong>8:00pm:</strong> Start getting ready for bed. I&#x27;ll brush my teeth and lay things out for the next day.</li><li><strong>8:30pm:</strong> Hop into bed and read for an hour to an hour and a half.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#x27;m sure just about all are aware, yesterday January 6, 2021, A group of Trump supporters stormed and broke into the US Capitol Building. I followed what was going on and it left me angry, upset, and utterly speechless.</p><p>Seeing everything happen and stewing on it 24 hours later, I&#x27;m still angry. In fact I&#x27;m beyond angry. This is probably going to be a little rambly and might not be as coherent as I would prefer, but the emotions are just so raw.</p><p>I&#x27;m angry that we currently have a Commander-in-Chief who has spent the last 4+ years sowing division in this country. I&#x27;m angry that he continually spouts his lies and attacks without any real pushback from the GOP. Make no mistake...the entire GOP is complicit in this. The evidence of how awful a man Trump is has been out there in the open for well beyond his Presidency. The vicious attacks he&#x27;s made from the campaign trail, and then the White House were plain as day. He&#x27;s been egging on his supporters and inciting violence since he began his campaign. Remember how he was offering to pay the legal fees of anyone who wanted to assault protestors at his rallies? Violence against his &quot;enemies&quot; is his thing. Anyone who is shocked or surprised by this has not been paying attention.</p><p>That any members of the Republican Party only now are coming out with any kind of force against him is what I would call &quot;too little, too late&quot;. Hell, less than 24 hours after the attack, you still had well over 100 GOP Senators and Representatives pushing to overturn an election that Joe Biden won freely and fairly. An election where the GOP actually did pretty well down ballot mind you. I wish I could understand their logic, especially those who were elected using the same ballots as Biden, the same voting technology as Biden, counted by the same election officials as Biden, and yet consider their election victory legitimate but Biden&#x27;s not. I mean I know <em>WHY</em> they&#x27;re doing it. They know there&#x27;s no voter fraud, that Joe Biden won fairly. They just have to bow down and lick the boots of their wannabe dictator-god. That Ted Cruz would use the thought that people believe the election was stolen as any kind of reasoning to object to the result is maddening. Reject the lies and disinformation being spread. Tell people the truth. Losing sucks and no one would blame anyone for being upset their side lost. It was disheartening for me in 2016 when Trump won. That didn&#x27;t mean that I raged and attacked D.C. That Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley would come out and criticize the protestors makes things even worse as both of them were primary causes of the violence.</p><p>I&#x27;m angry at every single person who voted for Trump. They&#x27;re partly responsible as well. I&#x27;m sorry, I generally don&#x27;t like to group everyone into this, but all the signs were there in 2016 and again in 2020 at how awful of a person Trump is and how completely unfit he is to hold such a position of power. They should take a long, hard look at themselves and think how they can support a President and a political party that has no problem throwing out an election or attacking its representatives if the result isn&#x27;t to their liking. Really think about it...the GOP is saying that if the result of an election doesn&#x27;t end with a GOP candidate winning, the election is rigged and illegitimate, and no amount of evidence to the contrary will change their mind.</p><p>I&#x27;m angry at the complete difference in reaction to this attack compared to the Black Lives Matter protests earlier in the year. The National Guard shot fucking rubber bullets and tear gas at peaceful protestors for a fucking photo op. This time, mostly white protestors break into the US Capitol Building, threaten the lives of our representatives and others, and what do the police do? They open the gates and take selfies with the insurrectionists. The difference? One group is Black, the other is white. I have no idea how anyone can look at this and NOT see the systemic racism that is going on. If this were the Black Lives Matter protest, there undoubtedly, and sadly would&#x27;ve been far more blood shed. At the end of the day 5 people so far, including 1 Capitol Police Officer lost their lives because Donald Trump is a sore loser and decided the best way to go forward was to incite his followers. He filled DC with gasoline and gunpowder, and handed them matches and lighters.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We‚Äôre not asking you to shoot them like you shoot us, we‚Äôre asking you to NOT shoot us like you don‚Äôt shoot them...</p>‚Äî Davontae Harris (@wichkid) <a href="https://twitter.com/wichkid/status/1346990204071108610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote><p>I think the thing that saddens me the most is that I really thought our institutions would hold up better. That the institutions we&#x27;ve fought for and built up over the last almost 250 years would dull the worst of Trump. Instead they just caved. The Attorney General had no problem acting as Trump&#x27;s &quot;personal&quot; lawyer despite his responsibility to be the country&#x27;s lawyer. I thought the systems of checks and balances would help. Instead, they were just rolled over.</p><p>Trump used his office to move forward one thing. Himself. Nothing else has ever mattered to him. If there&#x27;s nothing in it for him, he&#x27;s not interested. And sadly, that won&#x27;t go away even when he leaves the White House on January 20. Trumpism is here to stay. Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, and the rest of the GOP will make sure of that.</p><p>All we can do is keep fighting to make the ideals of America win again. The country has never been perfect, there has always been ways for it to improve. We must keep fighting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it&#x27;s probably the world&#x27;s biggest understatement to say that 2020 did not go the way I had envisioned it to go. And yet, the year has now come to a close.</p><p>If I had to come up with one <em>polite</em> word to use for 2020, it would probably be <strong>Trainwreck</strong>. I feel like that describes this year so perfectly. The year came to an abrupt &quot;oh shit&quot; moment in mid-March when COVID-19 spread across the world like nothing we&#x27;ve seen before. In the late spring and early summer we <em><strong>again</strong></em> faced the reality of social unrest after more murders of black men and women at the hand of the police. And to top it all off, in the fall we dealt with an election like no other took place between a raging, narcissistic, wannabe dictator and a capable, qualified candidate. One wouldn&#x27;t be blamed at all for forgetting that a lot of other things took place throughout the year.</p><p>But I think at this point, I&#x27;ll look a little closer to home.</p><h2>What My Year Looked Like</h2><p>First, I want to say that I am grateful for everything I have. As much as 2020 has sucked, the one thing that it has done is make me realize how much I have. I have a wonderful wife who I love more than anything. Without her, I don&#x27;t know how I could&#x27;ve made it through some of the darker days of the year. I have my health and a job that allows me to work from home. I know others aren&#x27;t nearly as fortunate.</p><p>My year started out like any other. I had set up 4 basic goals.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Diet (the one we&#x27;re all always working on)</strong>: You&#x27;d think that this one wouldn&#x27;t be too bad given that I cooked at home a lot more... Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the case...being home made it a little too easy to snack on things. Oh well. Given the lousy year, I&#x27;m not all that upset about it. I managed to do a lot of other things in my fitness realm. I <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html">built a home gym</a> I ended up <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/12/16/reflections-on-my-running-streak-coming-to-an-end.html">running 175 days in a row</a> and I topped 800 miles running for the year. Not perfect, but I&#x27;m mostly content with what I was able to do fitness-wise all things considered.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finish Digital Family Cookbook</strong>: I got so close on this one. For the moment it&#x27;s code-complete, but I suspect that there&#x27;s more I need to do to clean it up. I also need to figure out how to package it. Like many side projects, I got side-tracked by other, more-shiny things. I decided I needed to brush up on my .NET skills and learn what .NET Core is all about so I ended up using it to <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/07/05/so-i-finally-finished-a-side-project.html">rebuild Where Do You Want to Eat</a>. I ended up having to take it down due to hosting costs (I think I&#x27;ve found a more cost-effective alternative), but I can happily say I finished it. I also started a new side project to replace <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/01/21/tracking-my-fitness-journey.html">many of the spreadsheets I use to track my fitness</a>. It&#x27;s relatively early on in development, but I&#x27;m using it as a learning project for building a .NET Core Web API and for teaching myself TypeScript. It&#x27;s no wonder Digital Family Cookbook is sitting idle...</p></li><li><p><strong>Read More</strong>: This one I can say I was able to do. As my <a href="https://kpwags.com/reading-list/">reading list</a> shows, I was able to read quite a bit more this year compared to last. My reading mixed both fiction and nonfiction well. As much as I like learning when I read, sometimes it&#x27;s nice to leave the world of reality into a good story.</p></li><li><p><strong>Write More</strong>: This one was mixed. I feel like I wrote more posts, but don&#x27;t really know. Given everything that went on during the year, sometimes it was just hard to concentrate.</p></li></ul><h3>Other Things</h3><p>One other thing I ended up doing this year was <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/12/14/starting-a-new-job.html">choosing to leave my job for a new opportunity</a>. I&#x27;m only a month in, but am happy with where my career is heading.</p><h2>Looking Forward and Hoping 2021 is Better</h2><p>I&#x27;m not going to be naive and think that 2021 is going to get rid of all the ills of 2020. The Coronavirus is not going to go away January 1st even with the vaccine now being administered. Joe Biden getting inaugurated January 20th isn&#x27;t going to magically get rid of Trumpism. Fixing racial justice and correcting the structural racism in the world is not going to happen overnight. All of this will take time and effort on the part of everyone. 2020 just seemed to amplify everything.</p><p>What I can do, is try to change my mindset and make 2021 feel like a better year.</p><p>For 2021, I&#x27;m not going to really set any specific goals...more just things I want to work on.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Staying Active</strong>: I&#x27;d like to say 2021 will be the year I fix my diet, but I think we all know where that is heading... Instead, I&#x27;m going to focus on continuing to stay active. I&#x27;m going to continue to lift, run, walk &amp; bike. I&#x27;m going to try to cut down on the snacking, but the focus will be on getting stronger and moving more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improving my Development Knowledge</strong>: My work with Digital Family Cookbook, Where Do You Want to Eat 2, and now my fitness tracking side project have all helped with this. I&#x27;m going to continue working on my side projects to help improve my capabilities. I know it&#x27;s only been 1 month at my new job, but I already sense my abilities being pushed (which is a good thing) to help myself grow. I&#x27;m also hoping to publish Digital Family Cookbook, but I&#x27;m sensing I might rebuild it using .NET Core once my fitness tracker is complete...we shall see...I could find a new shiny-thing by then. The important thing to me is continuing to learn and grow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Continuing to Read</strong>: I don&#x27;t think much more needs to be said here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Write More</strong>: I say I&#x27;m going to do this every year. I have a list of topics I want to write about, but never seem to. I think I&#x27;m going to try to get over my &quot;impostor syndrome&quot; and start to write more. I say impostor syndrome because in some of the cases, I feel like part of my reluctance to write, is making myself sound stupid. I&#x27;m going to try to push that fear aside and write more, and use any mistakes I happen to make a way to learn and grow.</p></li></ol><p>I think I&#x27;ll finish up there. This is what I&#x27;m hoping to work on in 2021.</p><p>For those of you who have experienced loss and suffering this year, I hope 2021 and the future in general is better for you.</p><p>Here&#x27;s to a better 2021.

This left me with limited options for fitness (or at least options that appealed to me). Running had generally been my go-to cardio activity since I started becoming more active, so I started running, a lot. I started running 3-4 miles a day, 4-5 days a week. I hated sitting still, so it was a good way to get my blood flowing. I stayed away from parks and just ran around my neighborhood. Didn&#x27;t need a mask as I could just switch sides of the street those few times I ran into someone.</p><p>I missed the second half of April thanks to pain in my hip, but was able to get going again in May. Towards the end of June (June 22nd to be exact), I ended up starting my running streak. I didn&#x27;t actually even mean to start it. I just started running every day, and soon enough I realized that I had been able to keep it going. It reached a month, then two, and I was able to just keep going. Even after I <a href="/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html">built my gym</a>, I still made a point to go for a run after lifting...which became extra painful on some legs days. My only rule was that I had to hit the 1 mile mark for it to count. Anyone who wants to start a running streak can set the boundaries for their streaks, but for mine, I felt like 1 mile was a good mark to hit.</p><p>There were plenty of days where I didn&#x27;t want to run. Days where I just wanted to be lazy and play video games all day or anything else. But I persevered and went for a run anyway. There were days where my neighbors probably thought I was nuts running in the pouring rain (those were not fun runs). There were other days where I ran in 90+ degree weather...they weren&#x27;t fun either, though I tried sticking to morning runs during the hottest days of summer to make it a little easier on myself. I was proud of myself. I managed to hit 100 days, then 150, never seeming to slow down.</p><p>What finally did me in was a low to mid 30s day when it was pouring rain. I hadn&#x27;t been enjoying running with the temperature in the 30s to begin with, and the pouring rain certainly didn&#x27;t encourage me either. Not to make excuses for myself, but I kinda knew this day was coming. Living in Pennsylvania, I knew that the weather was going to get cold. And while I could deal with cold, what that also brings is snow and ice (as I write this, it&#x27;s snowing out and we&#x27;re supposed to get as much as a foot of snow). I knew that once it started getting icy, my runs were going to stop. Why run if all I&#x27;m going to do is slip on the ice and break an ankle or leg? I&#x27;ll end up injured and won&#x27;t be able to do much of anything. I was hoping to get to 183 days, so I could say that I ran exactly half the year, but I&#x27;ll have to make do with 175 days. Still not too shabby!</p><p>Looking back, I feel accomplished. It wasn&#x27;t always easy to force myself to run every day, but I still did it 175 days in a row. I think that&#x27;s the main takeaway from this for me. If you want something, stick with it. Work for it and don&#x27;t take the easy way out. It would&#x27;ve been easy for me to take a day off, say that it&#x27;s because I need a rest day and move on.</p><p>As for now, I&#x27;m still working out. I&#x27;m still lifting weights in my basement gym, and I&#x27;ll still go for runs when the weather cooperates. I&#x27;ll probably even get my bike trainer out and get some indoor bike rides in. My running streak might be over, but my fitness activities sure aren&#x27;t!</p><p>Here are the stats for my running streak:</p><div style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>Days</strong>: 175</div><div style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>Distance</strong>: 536.91 miles</div><div style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>Average Distance Ran</strong>: 3.07 miles</div><div style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>Time Running</strong>: 84 hours, 14 minutes, 33 seconds</div><div style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>Average Pace</strong>: 9:25/mi.</div><div style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>Running Shoes Gone Through</strong>: 1.25</div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of November, I ended up leaving my job at Maintenance Strategies, Inc. and made the decision to take on a new challenge working as a software developer at Webstaurant.</p><p>Changing jobs is often an anxious experience. You don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re making the right decsion. Various questions often run through your head. What if I hate the new job? What if I think my new co-workers are jerks? Is it even the right decision? The worry is even more enhanced by the fact that we&#x27;re living in the midst of a pandemic that has been going on for over 9 months with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/14/world/covid-19-coronavirus#america-begins-its-most-ambitious-vaccination-campaign">the end only now starting to come into view</a>.</p><p>I had been working at MSI for over 5 years and enjoyed my time working there. I had some fantastic co-workers and am ever thankful for the opportunities that I had while working there. Deciding to leave was not an easy decision.</p><p>My new job is with a company called Webstaurant where I&#x27;ll be specializing in C# and .NET development. My first project has me using .NET Core, TypeScript &amp; React. This is especially exciting for me since I&#x27;ll finally be able to put some of the skills and knowledge I&#x27;ve picked up on the side to use in a professional capacity.</p><p>My first day was actually last week and so far, so good. I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing my journey as a developer, continuing to learn and improve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;m sure many have experienced the problem of not being able to stick with one&#x27;s fitness goals. It&#x27;s a common problem. You decide I&#x27;m going to go to the gym a few days a week, you stick with it for a week or two, then get lazy. I&#x27;ve dealt with this and have found a way to &quot;trick&quot; myself into sticking with my goals.</p><h2>The So-Called Trick</h2><p>For me, I have had plenty of days where I had to drag myself to the gym. The trick I use is I&#x27;ll go to the gym (nowadays my basement) and I&#x27;ll do my first exercise. If I do all my sets of that and still don&#x27;t feel like doing any more, then I&#x27;ll give myself the OK to pack up and go home. More often than not, by the time I finish the first lift, I&#x27;ll be in a better mood and will want to finish my workout in its entirety. There are of course still times here and there where I am just done after that first lift. But even then, at least I did something and won&#x27;t regret being lazy and skipping the workout.</p><p>If lifting isn&#x27;t your thing, you can still apply this tactic elsewhere. With running for example, you could run around your block once and end early if you&#x27;re just not feeling it. You could also just commit to a short distance and increase if things get better.</p><h2>The Journey Matters More than the Individual Day</h2><p>At the end of the day, the important thing is being able to stick to your goals. We all have our bad days, but they will be forgotten soon enough. Quitting the journey, or losing the momentum takes a bit more to come back from.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know the Apple Watch has been around for over 5 years, and I&#x27;ve had one for almost 4, but I thought I&#x27;d share my reasons for still wearing it and why I like it.</p><p>Ever since high school, I&#x27;ve always been partial to wearing a watch. Even with the advent of the cell phone and smartphone, I&#x27;ve continued to wear a watch. In 2017, I purchased an Apple Watch Series 2 and have been happy with the purchase and the switch.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTE5OSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4OTgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyIgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4xIi8+"/></div><img alt="My Apple Watch" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="My Apple Watch" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-11-01-apple-watch%2Fapplewatch.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-11-01-apple-watch%2Fapplewatch.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-11-01-apple-watch%2Fapplewatch.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><h2>The History</h2><p>I jumped on the fitness tracker with the original Fitbit Flex back in 2013. It tracked my steps and my sleep, but didn&#x27;t have a clock on it...just a few dots to indicate progress. Because of this, I ended up with 2 devices on my wrist: the Fitbit and my watch. It wasn&#x27;t super ideal, but it served its purpose.</p><p>I had looked at the Apple Watch when Apple first released it, but found it a little lackluster for its price. The second generation Series 2 caused me to rethink things. The biggest addition for me was the built in GPS. The original Apple Watch could track runs and whatnot by GPS as well, but it required being tied to an iPhone. The series 2 allows you to track them independent of the iPhone. So if I don&#x27;t want to bring my iPhone with me, I don&#x27;t have to and I&#x27;ll still know how far I ran. I run a lot, so the ability to track my runs was incredibly important to me. I ended up pulling the trigger in January 2017 and entered the smart watch era.</p><p>In 2020, while fixing my dishwasher with my Dad, I ended up cracking the screen on my Series 2 and ended up upgrading to the Series 5 which is what I&#x27;m currently using today.</p><h2>What I Really Like</h2><h3>Basic Info At a Glance</h3><p>My watch face consists of some of the info I like to be able see at a glance. I can quickly view the weather, any events coming up, my fitness stats for the day, as well as easy access to starting a workout and my todo list. I can also easily customize this if I want to bring something else to the forefront. The weather &amp; rain are particularly useful to me right now since I&#x27;m currently on a run streak. On rainy days, it&#x27;s nice to be able to see quickly when I might be able to squeeze a run in.</p><h3>Fitness Tracking</h3><p>I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of tracking my fitness. For me it helps motivate me to keep trying to improve. Running is the big thing I&#x27;ve always liked seeing data for. When I first started running with any kind of seriousness, I used the popular app <a href="https://runkeeper.com/cms/">Runkeeper</a> on my phone. I moved to <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> when I got my Garmin GPS watch and also used <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> both with Garmin and with my Apple Watch. After Strava got into some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases">privacy trouble</a>, I decided to really try Apple&#x27;s built-in tracking. It was perfect for me and I ended up deleting my Strava account and sticking Apple&#x27;s app. The app works really well. It keeps track of my pace, distance, heart rate, gives me my mile splits, and keeps the activities private. There&#x27;s no easy way to share activities, but that&#x27;s fine by me...I don&#x27;t think anyone needs to see all that data anyway.</p><h3>Quick Notifications</h3><p>Assuming you&#x27;re careful with what notifications you want to see, being able to get them on your watch can be handy. I can have my phone in my pocket or somewhere around the house and still be able to check to see who messaged me or what task I&#x27;m being reminded to do.</p><h3>Streaming Music</h3><p>I use Spotify as my streaming music service, but I do have music stored on my iPhone from iTunes. The Apple Watch allows me to transfer some of those songs over to my watch which is nice for runs when I don&#x27;t want to carry my phone. I can connect my Bluetooth earbuds to my watch and off I go.</p><h3>Changing Watch Bands</h3><p>Okay, this one isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, but it&#x27;s nice that I can change my watch bands easily enough. People make jokes (rightfully so) about how expensive some of Apple&#x27;s bands can be, but the fact of the matter is that there are plenty of third parties who make some solid bands to fit anyone&#x27;s style. I tend to stick with the rubber bands since I use my watch for working out and it handles the sweat well, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to switch up the colors to fit my mood.</p><h2>Cons</h2><p>There are some cons to the Apple Watch to be aware of.</p><h3>Battery</h3><p>The battery on both my Series 2 and Series 5 have both been good. I can easily get through a day without having to worry about running out of juice. And since I don&#x27;t wear my watch to bed, it&#x27;s easy enough to charge it while I sleep. It does mean that whenever I go on any trips, it&#x27;s one extra charger I need to bring. And since the charger it uses is a variation of the wireless charging standard, you can&#x27;t even use a normal charging pad. (Apple really should <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21441290/apple-watch-qi-wireless-charging-standard-environment-cable-proprietary-standard">make the switch</a>) This also means it&#x27;s not a good option if you need to go several days without ready access to power (think backpacking trip).</p><h3>Expensive Screen Repair</h3><p>The reason I upgraded to the Series 5 was cost-related. $250 to repair a cracked screen on a 3 year old watch when the latest model cost $400 didn&#x27;t seem like a good investment. The Series 2 was still running well, and having to see it go to waste over a screen crack was disappointing, especially from an environmental perspective. (I did give it to Apple for their recycling program)</p><h3>Easy to Remain &quot;Too Connected&quot;</h3><p>One of the things I&#x27;ve tried to keep tabs on is my screen time. All too often it&#x27;s easy to become distracted by my iPhone. The Apple Watch can amplify that if you let it. I attacked this problem by severely limiting what notifications I receive on my watch. Right now I think the only notifications I let go through to my watch are phone calls, iMessage messages, todo reminders &amp; calendar notifications. Limiting what the watch buzzes about helps tremendously.</p><hr/><p>Smart watches aren&#x27;t for everyone and they definitely aren&#x27;t always the most stylish of watches. For me though, I am glad to have it as it does exactly what I want it to.</p>]]></content:encoded>

What this does is allow you to run a single test or run all tests in the open file from the context menu.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTk5OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMTIzIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Jest Runner in Action in VS Code" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Jest Runner in Action in VS Code" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-09-24-handy-visual-studio-code-plugin-for-jest%2Fjestrunner.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-09-24-handy-visual-studio-code-plugin-for-jest%2Fjestrunner.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-09-24-handy-visual-studio-code-plugin-for-jest%2Fjestrunner.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>Prior to this, I had 2 npm test scripts. One that runs all tests and stops, and a second that puts Jest in watch mode running every time I make changes to files included in tests. This was sometimes annoying when I just wanted one file or one test run as I would have to wait for all the other tests to run as well. Now I can just right click on the test and click &#x27;Run Jest&#x27; and boom...the console will open and the test will run.</p><p>I&#x27;d highly recommend!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two months ago, I decided to go for a run, something I&#x27;ve been doing during most of the pandemic. What I didn&#x27;t know was that this run would be the start of what would become a 2+ month running streak.</p><p>Since March when everything shut down due to the Coronovirus pandemic, running became one of the only physical activities I felt comfortable doing. I was doing a pretty good job running 4-5 times per week and staying active which has definitely been important for keeping my spirits up. I have no idea what made me start this running streak, but five or so days into it, I decided to just keep it going to see how long I could go. My only rule was that a run had to be 1 mile for it to count. So far, this hasn&#x27;t been an issue, my shortest run was 1.28 miles which was the day after my first legs workout with my <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html">home gym</a> which killed my legs and made running quite a challenge for a few days while I was dealing with the DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness). On average, I&#x27;m hitting 3.12 miles per run, right around a 5k.</p><p>Every week, I&#x27;ve been proud of myself for keeping it going. I&#x27;ve never taxed my legs like this, even when I was training for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon. Given that I&#x27;ve generally maxed out at 5, maybe 6 runs a week, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d handle the load. Today I hit 9 weeks and so far, my legs are holding up. Some days are better than others and I&#x27;ve limited my distance per run as to try to not overdo it. I ended up starting this at the end of June and given my distaste for the heat, I&#x27;m actually surprised I&#x27;ve been able to keep it up even with temperatures in the 90s. Early morning runs have certainly helped with the heat, but even in the morning, I come back drenched in sweat. I am also hoping the weather holds up. I&#x27;ve had to time some of my runs trying to avoid the rain. I don&#x27;t have access to a treadmill so if I want to run, it has to be outside. I&#x27;ve done a few runs while it&#x27;s been drizzling which haven&#x27;t been the most fun. Not sure I&#x27;m hardcore enough to run if it&#x27;s a downpour.</p><p>Let&#x27;s see how far I can take this...I&#x27;m not planning on stopping anytime soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Four months into the COVID-19 Pandemic, I finally broke down and built a gym in my basement.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four months into the COVID-19 Pandemic, I finally broke down and built a gym in my basement.</p><p>Back in March when the country shut down because of the Coronavirus, my trips to the gym were one of the first things to go. I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable going and it didn&#x27;t matter because LA Fitness closed their gyms anyway. My wife was even awesome enough to give me the OK to buy and build a home gym setup since she knew it was important to me. But back in March, I hesitated to spend the money on it since I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be cheap and I wasn&#x27;t sure how long this lock down would last. Foolish me, I thought we would be out of it in a month or two. I ended up switching to running over the last 4 months. I&#x27;ve logged more miles than I have in just about any year other than 2015 when I was training for my marathon. As I write this, I&#x27;m currently on a 44 day running streak after putting up over 100 miles in July. Suffice it to say, that&#x27;s kept me occupied.</p><p>At the end of June however, LA Fitness notified me that they were planning on opening back up and would resume charging me my monthly rate. I still don&#x27;t feel comfortable going back to the gym so I looked into freezing or suspending my membership. Well that didn&#x27;t work as I expected and LA Fitness wanted to charge me $10 a month to &quot;suspend&quot; my membership. Basically I&#x27;d have to pay them $10 a month, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go to the gym either. That was a raw deal, so I opted to cancel my membership instead. After confirming that I was still able to make the purchases neccesary to build a home gym, I set out to price things out.</p><p>I was hoping to buy things used to save some money, but the selection on Craigslist was minimal and the stuff that was there was the cheap stuff marked up 300+%. I kept an eye on Craigslist, but in the end I ended up buying everything new. The hardest part was finding what I needed and wanted in stock. It seems that I&#x27;m not the only person looking to build a home gym. Finding barbells, plates, and other equipment in stock was a challenge in an of itself. Thankfully I found the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym">Home Gym Subreddit</a>. It has a regular In Stock Thread where users are awesome enough to announce when the various different shops have gear in stock. Sorting by new, I was able to find when barbells and plates came in stock on the various different shops.

I called it ‚ÄúWhere Do You Want to Eat‚Äù It was simple. You typed in a zip code (the site did try to get your zip code using Google‚Äôs API), specified a range with optional keywords, and it randomly chose a restaurant. I ended up sunsetting it down after Google ended up changing how they charge for use of their API. I wasn‚Äôt mad of course, they let me use it for free for a while. It didn‚Äôt hurt that my little toy was hardly used. It also didn‚Äôt always provide the best results. The range was a radius, and you‚Äôd be surprised how close some places are that seem farther away. The final nail so to speak was that the results were hard to fine-tune. All too often restaurants were returned that didn‚Äôt seem to match the keywords as much as you‚Äôd want.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTYwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Screen shot of the original Where Do You Want to Eat" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Screen shot of the original Where Do You Want to Eat" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-07-05-so-i-finally-finished-a-side-project%2Fwhere-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-07-05-so-i-finally-finished-a-side-project%2Fwhere-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-07-05-so-i-finally-finished-a-side-project%2Fwhere-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>In the end, it was a cool little project. It might not have turned into anything, but I learned a bit and that‚Äôs what matters.</p><h2>From the Scrap Heap</h2><p>I‚Äôve been developing in .NET since I graduated from Drexel in 2007, but I realized earlier this year that I haven‚Äôt really explored everything going on in .NET Core. Over the course of the year, especially during this pandemic, I‚Äôve been catching up on what‚Äôs been introduced in .NET Core.</p><p>I decided to use this time to bring back <em>Where Do You Want to Eat</em> but with a slightly different premise. Instead of relying on a geolocation API, I decided that I would build it to support user accounts where the users would enter in all the restaurants themselves. I figured it would improve the results if users put in their own restaurants. Restaurant discovery would take a hit as it could never return a restaurant not in your list, but I felt like that was a reasonable tradeoff. I‚Äôd also let the user assign tags to each restaurant so that during the random selection, they could narrow down the results a little (like if they knew they weren‚Äôt in the mood for say Sushi).</p><h2>The Technology</h2><p>I decided to use ASP.NET Core MVC as the base technology. I had used ASP.NET MVC in previous jobs and projects, and it seemed the best foundation to start for this project. For the data modeling side of things, I used Microsoft‚Äôs Entity Framework which made setting up the data layer a breeze. The template that comes with .NET Core 3.1 also included Bootstrap for the UI framework so I decided to stick with that. It did make building the UI easy by having the CSS formatting all set up, which I suppose is the point.</p><p>The final thing I did was get myself familiar with the .NET Unit Testing tools. Despite all my experience in the .NET Framework, I‚Äôve never done any unit testing. My first foray into unit testing was with <a href="https://kpwags.com/2020/05/06/delving-into-unit-testing.html">Jest and the React Testing Library for another side project</a>. I ended up using <a href="https://xunit.net/">xUnit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/moq/moq4">Moq</a> to do the heavy lifting. I had to get my head around how they handled the mock data, but once I got that down, setting up the tests were pretty easy. The experience I had in the Node.js and React world definitely came in handy to know what I wanted to test and how to go about laying the tests themselves out.</p><h2>Hosting</h2><p>From the start, I knew I wanted to use Microsoft Azure for hosting. I used Amazon Web Services for most of my projects, but decided I‚Äôd give Azure at try to see how easy it is to use. Since I built the site in .NET Core, it only made sense. I managed to get it up and running relatively easily thanks to several tutorials I found online. I‚Äôm a little concerned on the cost factor, so I‚Äôm going to have to see after a month or two what it costs me and if I‚Äôm going to have to find a different hosting platform. I‚Äôm not really sure how to monetize it outside of ads, and depending on the cost, I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd generate enough to compensate. I don‚Äôt mind paying to host it of course, and I‚Äôm hoping it won‚Äôt end up costing too much since it‚Äôs probably not going to get a lot of usage and won‚Äôt need a lot of data processing. If the costs are too high, I‚Äôll have to look into some alternatives.</p><p>I found that it was a fun little project to build, and a good learning experience. I do find it kind of odd to release it during a pandemic where we probably shouldn‚Äôt be going out to eat, but for now it can still be used for takeout. So please feel free to check it out, test it out, and let me know what you think!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôm going to preface this by saying that I am by no means an expert when it comes to all the nuances of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. I do however know that Section 230 serves as the underpinning of how the current Internet works and why all the sites that we all love can survive and exist.</p><blockquote><p>For even better coverage of Section 230, I‚Äôd highly recommend you follow <a href="https://www.techdirt.com">Techdirt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mmasnick">Mike Masnick</a> on Twitter.</p></blockquote><p>The biggest thing Section 230 provides is protection for website owners from content their users post. It means that when a user posts a Tweet or someone posts on Facebook, Twitter and Facebook aren‚Äôt held legally responsible should user post libel or anything else that might open them up for legal repercussions. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine how many issues website owners would have without this protection...especially smaller sites with comment sections. It also gives them the protections to moderate their sites however they choose without having to worry about it affecting their protection.</p><p>Now we can certainly debate <em>HOW</em> sites like Twitter or Facebook moderate their users, but that doesn‚Äôt change how important Section 230 is for today‚Äôs internet. Think about YouTube. YouTube has hundreds of hours of video uploaded by users per minute. There is absolutely no way that they can check each and every video as they‚Äôre uploaded. They don‚Äôt have the manpower...no company does. Automation and A.I. might help some, but they often create many false positives or miss things altogether. Imagine if someone uploads an awful video and Google is responsible for the contents of the video even if it‚Äôs only online for a short period before they remove it. If they could be held liable for that, it would be disastrous. There&#x27;s no way they couldn‚Äôt take that risk. If companies as big and as resourceful as Google can‚Äôt do it, what hope do smaller site owners have?</p><p>I write this now as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200528/01321044592/two-things-to-understand-about-trumps-executive-order-social-media-1-distraction-2-legally-meaningless.shtml">Donald Trump</a>, the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200617/13341644736/justice-department-releases-own-preposterous-recommendations-updating-section-230.shtml">U.S. Department of Justice</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200617/09243044732/senator-hawleys-section-230-reform-even-dumber-than-we-expected-would-launch-ton-vexatious-lawsuits.shtml">Republican Senators</a> are trying to gut these protections. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200531/01363144611/joe-biden-wastes-huge-opportunity-to-support-free-speech-still-wants-to-revoke-section-230.shtml">Joe Biden</a> isn‚Äôt much better as he‚Äôs no real fan of Section 230 either. This is all a mistake. Section 230 makes the Internet a much more diverse and better place. It‚Äôs ironic too, because while Trump is hating on Twitter now, he‚Äôs benefitting from Section 230. Without Section 230, Twitter would likely be driven to completely remove many of Trump‚Äôs Tweets...rather than just putting a violence or misleading tag.</p><h2>Publisher vs. Platform (It Does Not Mean What You Think it Means)</h2><p>One of the common arguments against sites like Facebook and Twitter is the false ‚Äúpublisher versus platform‚Äù distinction. This doesn‚Äôt mean what many seem to think it means. So many arguments I‚Äôve seen is ‚ÄúTwitter has to choose between being a publisher or being a platform...since they‚Äôre moderating, they‚Äôve chosen publisher!‚Äù (or something along those lines)</p><p>Let‚Äôs look at Twitter as en example. It‚Äôs generally considered a platform since they host other users‚Äô content. But it can also publish its own content like their blog and whatnot. Twitter is not responsible for its users&#x27; Tweets, but it <em>IS</em> responsible for content it posts itself. That‚Äôs essentially what the whole distinction is. It‚Äôs not really an either/or proposition.</p><h2>The 1st Amendment Argument Against Social Media is Bullshit</h2><p>There‚Äôs been a lot of complaints from those primarily in the GOP and on the right about social media being biased against conservatives. I personally find their claims dubious at best, but they seem to believe that sites like Twitter are responsible for holding up the standards of the 1st Amendment and Freedom of Speech. What they seem to forget, is that these sites are private companies. They are not the government, so the 1st Amendment does not apply to them. Social media sites have to determine how best to moderate their community. If they‚Äôre too open, they could drive away users who might be disgusted by questionable content. If they‚Äôre too strict, they could also drive away users as the majority of people do appreciate and want the ability to freely express themselves. But this is for the sites to decide, not the government.</p><p>At the end of the day, Twitter, Facebook, and every other site have the ability to moderate their sites as they see fit. If users don‚Äôt like it, they can find a different community or start their own. The alternative is that the government regulates what users can post on social media which would likely abused by whichever political party is in power. I think we can all agree that would be bad.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNTY2IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjU3NyIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img alt="xkcd: Free Speech Comic" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="xkcd: Free Speech Comic" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-06-24-section-230-should-be-protected%2Fxkcd_free_speech.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-06-24-section-230-should-be-protected%2Fxkcd_free_speech.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-06-24-section-230-should-be-protected%2Fxkcd_free_speech.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div><div class="PostImage__ImageCaptionCredit-sc-1y69a4k-1 jBBHlI">Credit <a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/" title="xkcd: Free Speech Comic">xkcd</a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all of my professional experience, I&#x27;ve never worked for a company that did any unit testing and because of that, I haven&#x27;t really done any either. I knew what unit testing is and the general concepts behind it, but never got around to actually building or implementing any tests. I decided that for Digital Family Cookbook, that would change.</p><p>I started my testing using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> &amp; <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/">Enzyme</a> since that&#x27;s what Wes Bos used for his React/GraphQL tutorials that got me started. I got through a few tests, but never really gained the confidence that my tests were either useful or actually working. The biggest thing I had to wrap my head around was mocking the data and the calls to the backend. I struggled a bit trying to figure out how to best handle pulling and posting data. Needless to say, the struggle didn&#x27;t exactly help my desire to keep going.</p><p>As luck would have it, I started following <a href="https://kentcdodds.com">Kent Dodds</a> a while back on Twitter and stumbled into a few of his tweets talking about <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro">React Testing Library</a> and decided to look into it. After reading the documentation and going through some tutorials and Stack Overflow posts, I decided to ditch Enzyme and try it out to see if I would have any better luck. It turns out this was the breakthrough I was looking for. The other library I found thanks to some digging was the <a href="https://github.com/mike-gibson/mock-apollo-client">Mock Apollo Client</a> which helped me understand and figure out how to handle mapping my mocked data for the tests.</p><p>There&#x27;s been a lot of trial and error. I&#x27;ve had a lot of tests fail when I figured they should succeed. I&#x27;ve had some pass when I figured they would fail...and then investigated into why they succeeded. Through this, I was able to gain confidence that the tests are working, and doing what I expect them to do. I also know they&#x27;re working because when I intentionally &quot;break&quot; components, the tests quickly let me know. That&#x27;s another thing I&#x27;ve learned throughout all of this. Make your tests fail too so you can have the confidence that they&#x27;ll fail when you break something unintentionally.</p><p>I ended up creating a list of components I wanted to test. I chose the components that made the most sense to make sure things continue to work. Components like logging in, signing up, the various CRUD calls to the database, etc. I&#x27;m now probably about halfway through adding the unit tests to Digital Family Cookbook. In retrospect, I should probably have done this as I went along. While I fully understand and appreciate the need for unit testing, compared to writing code and building new features, it&#x27;s rather boring. Spending all of this time writing and building the tests occasionally makes me want to just procrastinate and do something else. Had I written the tests as I went along, then the monotony might not have seemed as bad. I definitely will do that for my next project.</p><p>In the end, I&#x27;m definitely glad I&#x27;m learning this. It will only help my development of Digital Family Cookbook and any future projects I work on. It also can&#x27;t help when it comes to my professional career.</p><p>Here&#x27;s a list of articles, resources and other links that have helped me, so take a look, maybe they&#x27;ll help you too!</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/">Kent C. Dodds on Twitter</a> (Seriously, follow him, he&#x27;s often insightful in many ways)</li><li><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library">Common mistakes with React Testing Library</a></li><li><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-not-wrapped-in-act-warning">Fix the &quot;not wrapped in act(...)&quot; warning</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/testing-apollo-react-hooks-a7698067b8a0">Testing Apollo React Hooks</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-tested-a-react-app-with-jest-testing-library-and-cypress-here-are-the-differences-3192eae03850">I tested a React app with Jest, Enzyme, Testing Library and Cypress.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve often joked that the recipe project I‚Äôve been working on is my ‚Äúwhite whale‚Äù. I have in the past thrown everything out only to start over. I first built it in Ruby on Rails, but it was buggy and my limited knowledge of Rails made it a little hard to debug and figure out exactly what was wrong. I opted to rebuild it in PHP since I was quite familiar with PHP after building OpenVoter. I decided then that I wanted to start over to teach myself Node.js...well you get the idea.</p><p>My latest go at it has been React with Node.js and GraphQL. This time, things are going better. I‚Äôm currently pretty far along with it and have some things to clean up, some bugs to fix, and unit tests to write.</p><p>I mention the whole restarting the project because I‚Äôve spent the last week or two going through the code and converting everything from React class components to functional components and introducing React Hooks to the code. This has at times felt like I‚Äôve started over, though with a little less work.</p><p>I use the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/">Apollo</a> library in my project to handle the GraphQL queries for data. When I originally built the app, Hooks weren‚Äôt yet a thing and I ended up building everything using class components. Hooks were introduced, but I didn‚Äôt pay all that much attention to it as I wanted to finish the app and figured I could loop back later.</p><p>That changed when I was trying to solve a GraphQL Mutation bug I was having and looking over the Apollo documentation. They changed their docs to focus on hooks and I was immediately drawn to how much cleaner the code looked. I decided to upgrade the version of React (and just about every other library) I was using and started to convert a few small components over to hooks to see how they worked. Well, let‚Äôs just say I was hooked (ok, that was a bad pun, sorry!). I didn‚Äôt end up converting everything over to hooks, but I stopped using class components for all new functionality.</p><p>To give you an idea how much cleaner things looked, compare</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Query query={ALL_CATEGORIES_QUERY}&gt;
    {({ data, error, loading }) =&gt; {
        if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
        if (error) return &lt;p&gt;Error: {error.message}&lt;/p&gt;;
        return (
            &lt;ul className=&quot;child-list&quot;&gt;
                {data.categories.length &gt; 0 ? (
                    data.categories.map((category) =&gt; (
                        &lt;li key={category.id}&gt;
                            &lt;Link href={`/category?id=${category.id}`}&gt;
                                &lt;a&gt;{category.name}&lt;/a&gt;
                            &lt;/Link&gt;
                        &lt;/li&gt;
                    ))
                ) : (
                    &lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;em&gt;No Categories Defined&lt;/em&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                )}
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        );
    }}
&lt;/Query&gt;
</code></pre><p>to</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(ALL_CATEGORIES_QUERY);

if (loading) return &lt;li /&gt;;
if (error) return &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;;

return (
    &lt;ul className=&quot;child-list&quot;&gt;
        {data.categories.length &gt; 0 ? (
            data.categories.map((category) =&gt; (
                &lt;li key={category.id}&gt;
                    &lt;Link href={`/category?id=${category.id}`}&gt;
                        &lt;a&gt;{category.name}&lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;/Link&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            ))
        ) : (
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;em&gt;No Categories Defined&lt;/em&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        )}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>To me, the new code looks so much better, and easier to understand than the old. After working with unit tests and other clean-up tasks, I decided to spend some time to convert all of my components over to the hooks and am really glad I did. The time spent was worth it, and now I feel like I‚Äôm in better shape to finally finish up this project. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, just like many others across the country and the world, I‚Äôm now practicing social distancing and staying home just about all the time. While I‚Äôm fortunate in that I have a job that allows me to work from home, I can‚Äôt help but to think of all those who aren‚Äôt as fortunate and have either lost their job or have to go to work and potentially put their health and life on the line. Doctors, nurses, first responders and others are braving this and they deserve nothing but praise and respect for working through these tough times.</p><p>I‚Äôve been spending my time trying to stay busy and not get too stir-crazy. I, like many others haven‚Äôt experienced anything like this before in my life. I‚Äôm not used to staying home all the time, not being able to really do anything outside of the home, not being able to go anywhere. It feels really weird to me.</p><p>Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been up to in an attempt to stay occupied.</p><h3>Running</h3><p>Since my gym closed, I‚Äôve been limited as to what I can do for fitness. I could do bodyweight exercises, but haven‚Äôt been in the mood. Running has been my go-to exercise. So much so that my monthly mileage for March was over 60 miles. I haven‚Äôt run this much since I was training for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon. I may regret it later, but between all this running and reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CMXZC7L">The Incomplete Book of Running</a> by Peter Sagal, I‚Äôm actually considering signing up for the 2020 Philadelphia Marathon. I haven‚Äôt made the decision yet, but I‚Äôm giving it serious thought.</p><h3>Puzzles</h3><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iOTYyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMzNyIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img alt="Puzzle my wife and I completed of New York City" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Puzzle my wife and I completed of New York City" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-03-31-quarantine-update%2Fnyc-puzzle.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-03-31-quarantine-update%2Fnyc-puzzle.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-03-31-quarantine-update%2Fnyc-puzzle.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>My wife and I have spent some evenings working on puzzles. This is the first one we did, a 750 piece panoramic shot of New York City (The sky was annoying!). We have since started a 2,000 piece puzzle of a scene from the Dolomites in Northern Italy.</p><h3>Side Projects and Blog Improvements</h3><p>I‚Äôve been spending some of my time improving my blog. I completely re-did my <a href="https://kpwags.com/reading-list">Reading List</a> and my <a href="https://kpwags.com/current">Current</a> pages. I decided to make the books stand out a little more by adding the covers. I used CSS grid to make arrange them, and for the first time, used the HTML &lt;picture&gt; tag to try to make it a little quicker to load on mobile. It seems to be working.</p><p>I‚Äôve also spent some of the time working on my recipes site side project. I‚Äôve been teaching myself how to setup Unit Testing since it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never done. It‚Äôs been a little frustrating at times, but I‚Äôm getting there. I‚Äôve been using <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">React Apollo</a> to handle the GraphQL queries, and I‚Äôve been re-writing the components to use Hooks. It might delay its release, but after making the changes, I can see why people prefer hooks‚Ä¶the code looks so much cleaner.</p><h3>Reading</h3><p>So far since this has started, I‚Äôve been reading quite a bit. I ended up finishing 3 books so far, and last night I started on my 4th. I‚Äôve already increased my book count for 2020.</p><hr/><p>I hope you‚Äôre all staying safe out there. Stay home and practice social distancing. Stay healthy, and we‚Äôll all get through this.</p><p>How are you all keeping yourself busy?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I‚Äôve been trying to do while getting in shape is tracking my progress. Weight is obviously one of the metrics I track, but it‚Äôs not the only one.</p><h2>Diet</h2><p>Every day, I use MyFitnessPal to log what I eat and drink. I‚Äôve tried other services like LoseIt and Cronometer, but for all its issues, it works the best for me.</p><p>Despite this, I still want to be able to keep track of things should MyFitnessPal become unusable for whatever reason or a better service comes along. To accomplish this, I copy the basic data into an Excel spreadsheet. I don‚Äôt go so crazy as to copy all the food I eat into the spreadsheet, but I input my calories, protein, fat &amp; carbs intake. This helps me see trends and see how I‚Äôm doing.</p><p>I also grade myself daily for what I eat. I grade myself based on where I‚Äôm at with regards to my daily goals.</p><h3>Calories</h3><ul><li>Up to 109% of my goal: 3 points</li><li>110-119%: 2 points</li><li>120% or more: 0 points</li></ul><h3>Protein</h3><ul><li>90% or more: 3 points</li><li>80-89%: 2 points</li><li>&lt; 80%: 0 points</li></ul><h3>Carbs &amp; Fat</h3><ul><li>Up to 109% of my goal: 2 points</li><li>110-119%: 1 points</li><li>120% or more: 0 points</li></ul><p>I give myself a total of 10 points a day, weighted more on protein and calories. It might seem a little crazy, and it probably is, but I‚Äôve found that it helps keep me at least a little more honest with improving my diet.

With lifting, I feel the best way to make sure you‚Äôre progressing, is to make sure you‚Äôre tracking your lifts. At the gym, I use a moleskin notebook to keep track of my lifts. I used to use the Strong App, but tried paper and found I liked it better. I fill out my lifts for the cycle through and check off each set as I complete it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another year has passed and it‚Äôs been a tradition of mine as of late to look back on the year that was to see what I hoped to have done, what I did, and where I might improve. I really wish I knew where 2019 went because it seemed to have just flown by. It seemed like it was just yesterday that I was writing about 2018, looking onward to 2019. Now 2019 is gone, the new decade has <a href="https://xkcd.com/2249/">maybe?</a> begun, and I‚Äôm a year older.</p><h2>First, Let‚Äôs Look Back to What I Wanted to Accomplish</h2><p>Heading into 2019, I set several goals for myself.</p><ol><li><strong>Lose Weight</strong>: I had been struggling getting my diet under control for several years with a lot of progress and then relapses.</li><li><strong>Read More</strong>: After reading like a fiend for several years, my reading had tapered off and I was hoping to read more.</li><li><strong>Build My Side Project</strong>: I had plenty of false starts working on my new side project. Building part of it and then not liking where it was, etc. I wanted to actually finish it and teach myself Node.js, React, &amp; GraphQL in the process.</li><li><strong>Write More</strong>: I‚Äôve been neglecting writing actual content for my blog and even had an idea for a novel. I wanted to write more for both.</li></ol><h2>What Went Well in 2019</h2><h3>I was able to significantly progress in my strength training.</h3><p>I went into 2019 setting strength goals of squatting 275 lbs., benching 225 lbs., deadlifting 400 lbs., and hitting 150 lbs. on the Overhead Press. I was able to hit each of these goals except for deadlift. In July, I switched to the <a href="https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/">nSuns</a> lifting routine and was able to really increase my main lifts. I think part of it was psychological, realizing that I could actually lift the heavier weights. (As an aside, seeing the weight go up on squats was kind of scary to me prepping for the heavy sets.)</p><p>I managed to get to</p><ul><li>300 lbs. on squats</li><li>230 lbs. on bench press</li><li>160 lbs. on overhead press</li><li>345 lbs. on deadlift</li></ul><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTI0NSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3NjUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyIgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4xIi8+"/></div><img alt="Charts showing progress in squat, bench press, deadlift &amp; overhead press" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Charts showing progress in squat, bench press, deadlift &amp; overhead press" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019%2F2019-strength-training-charts.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019%2F2019-strength-training-charts.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019%2F2019-strength-training-charts.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>Not too shabby.</p><p>I stalled out some on overhead press and bench press, but I‚Äôm slowly working my way back up. Better to go slowly and not hurt myself.</p><h3>I made significant progress on my side project.</h3><p>Thanks to Wes Bos‚Äô <a href="https://advancedreact.com/">Advanced React tutorial</a>, I was able to gain a grasp on React &amp; GraphQL and make real progress on my side project currently called ‚ÄòDigital Family Cookbook‚Äô. The web app is mostly complete. I‚Äôm currently working on tidying some things up and unit testing. I haven‚Äôt really done something like this in a while so I‚Äôve been pretty excited seeing the progress.</p><h3>I did manage to lose some weight.</h3><p>I wasn‚Äôt able to completely fix my diet, but I did manage to lose 15 or so pounds. Could‚Äôve done better, but I did better than previous years.</p><h3>I started playing goalie in hockey.</h3><p>This wasn‚Äôt really a goal for me at the beginning of the year, but in September, I started playing goalie in ice hockey. I was able to borrow the gear from a fellow goalie in the lower league, tried it in some practice sessions, and decided I enjoyed it. I‚Äôve since purchased the gear and just finished my first season. I had some good games, but I also had some stinkers as well. Either way, I‚Äôve had a lot of fun playing the position and intend to continue playing goalie in the lower league and skate out in the upper league.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMjAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Me tending the net as a hockey goalie" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Me tending the net as a hockey goalie" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019%2Fme-as-goalie.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019%2Fme-as-goalie.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2020-01-05-yearly-wrapup-and-retrospective-2019%2Fme-as-goalie.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><h2>What I Struggled With in 2019</h2><h3>I didn‚Äôt write nearly as much as I wanted.</h3><p>Looking at my blog, it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to realize that I didn‚Äôt write all that much or add that much content. I had a bunch of weekly reading lists, but that‚Äôs not quite the same as pieces that have depth to them. I did start outlining an idea I‚Äôve had for a novel. The idea isn‚Äôt new, but I started to lay it out. But that‚Äôs about as far as I got. I ended up getting distracted with other things and let it go by the wayside.</p><h3>I didn‚Äôt read that much.</h3><p>Social media played a bit of a role in this one. I was trying to go to bed a little on the early side so I could read for a bit before bed. All too often though, I ended up pulling out my iPad instead of my Kindle. Part of it I might chalk up to some of the books I‚Äôve read and am currently reading. Some tended to be rather dense (good books, but just diving into their subjects deeply) and I wasn‚Äôt always in the mood to really focus. The book I‚Äôm currently reading, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062405667">Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975</a> by Max Hastings is a fantastic look into Vietnam, but requires a lot of focus to keep up with what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs also almost 900 pages. I hope to finish by the end of the month.</p><h3>I was a little too loose with my diet.</h3><p>This one is pretty much everyone‚Äôs achilles heel it seems. I was no different. I went through stretches of being good and not over-indulging, only to follow it up with some less than disciplined days. I made progress, but not as much as I could have.</p><h2>What I Hope to Accomplish in 2020</h2><p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to change my goals for 2020. I‚Äôm going to stick with last year‚Äôs goals and do better.</p><ol><li><strong>Continue Working on My Diet</strong>: Not much more needs to be said here. The one thing I‚Äôm going to try to change though is to do better to record what I eat and drink in <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a>. I think some of the days I realized I was going to exceed my goals (not in a good way), I just stopped entering what I ate. Maybe by entering in more, I might be able to look at things in a different way and hopefully make some positive changes. I know I‚Äôm still going to have some days that might not be ideal for my diet, but screw it, I only live once and I‚Äôm not going to cut out all of the junk...just hopefully lessen the amount of times that happens.</li><li><strong>Finish Up My Side Project</strong>: This one should hopefully not take too much longer. I hope to finish it, figure out the best way to deploy it, and share it with the world. I have a few other ideas for other projects as well, so who knows, maybe I‚Äôll end up building more in some of my free time.</li><li><strong>Read More</strong>: My reading list has continued to grow, so I‚Äôm going to need to spend some time knocking out more of it. My plan is to cut back some on social media, Reddit especially. While I enjoy some good nonfiction, reading about history and whatnot, I‚Äôm thinking I might also lighten my reading a little bit and try to knock out some of the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù reads off my list. Hopefully that will make it easier to pick up a book rather than my iPad. I do plan on continuing to read my subscription to <em>The Economist</em>, but hopefully I can mix that in well enough.</li><li><strong>Write More</strong>: This one is probably going to continue to be a little tougher for me, but I‚Äôm hoping I can set some time aside and put some focus into it. I think one thing that always scares me with blog posts, especially ones focusing on technical subjects is making a mistake and writing something that turns out being wrong (<a href="https://www.xkcd.com/386/">Relevant xkcd</a>). If I can will myself past that and get used to correcting myself when I ‚Äúoops‚Äù, it should help me on my way. I‚Äôm hoping to make some progress both in writing more blog posts as well as maybe some work on my novel.</li></ol><h2>What Are Your Goals for 2020?</h2><p>What are your goals for the new year?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I‚Äôve been making steady progress on my side project, which I‚Äôm currently calling <em>Digital Family Cookbook</em>. I‚Äôm making it as a content management system for cooking recipes. As I‚Äôve mentioned previously, I‚Äôm writing it using Node.js, React, &amp; GraphQL. It‚Äôs been quite a learning curve, but I‚Äôm definitely glad I‚Äôve been working on it. The tools are pretty cool and easy-ish to use once you get used to the syntax and some of the idiosyncrasies of React and JSX.</p><h2>It‚Äôs different from what I‚Äôm used to</h2><p>Most of what I‚Äôve written in the past has been Javascript interacting with a server running PHP or .NET, so I‚Äôm generally used to the way they work and run. I think the biggest thing that I‚Äôve had to remember is that Node is just javascript and it runs synchronously so I have to be cognizant of that. I‚Äôm generally used to my server code running asynchronously and not having to worry as much about race conditions. Getting data from a SQL server in let‚Äôs say .NET will run the query and not move on until the query is complete. With Node, I have to make sure I don‚Äôt move on before the data fetch is complete. In ES5, this generally meant callback hell. Thankfully with promises, combined with async/await in ES6, this has become a little easier to manage, but it did have me confused for a little bit not thinking.</p><h3>The ‚ÄúGotcha‚Äù Moment</h3><p>The perfect example of having to remember this difference was with what I‚Äôm currently working on. The feature I‚Äôm currently working on is the form to create recipes. I managed to get the form working, I got the data sent to the server, the recipe was created, but none of the directions or ingredients were attached to the recipe. I looked in the database and the directions were there, as were the ingredients, but the recipe had no idea they existed. I thought maybe the server wasn‚Äôt getting the data, but a console.log quickly showed me it was. What I failed to take into account was that the forEach function on the directions and ingredients array was not being awaited like I thought it was.</p><p>I wrote the code to go through each ingredient and direction, add it to the database, and add its ID to an array. Then in the create recipe mutation, add the connections. Because it wasn‚Äôt being awaited, the arrays didn‚Äôt get populated by the time it was running the create recipe mutation so no link was ever created‚Ä¶oops!</p><p>A quick change corrected that problem and all of a sudden, the form worked as expected.</p><pre><code class="language-js">const directionCreations = formValues.directions.map(async (d) =&gt; {
    const direction = await ctx.db.mutation.createDirection(
        {
            data: {
                direction: d.direction,
                sortOrder: d.sortOrder,
            },
        },
        ‚Äò{ id }‚Äô,
    );

    return direction;
});

const directions = await Promise.all(directionCreations);
</code></pre><p>In the end, it was a pretty easy mistake to make, but it‚Äôs one I‚Äôm going to remember and learn from.</p><h2>Moving Forward</h2><p>I still have quite a bit of work to do on the project, but it‚Äôs nice to see some real progress on what I‚Äôm working on. I‚Äôm definitely enjoying the learning process and am excited to see some of my ideas come to life. I could have built this in a language like PHP, .NET or something I‚Äôm more familiar with and be done more quickly, but seeing the power of modern Javascript, GraphQL and Node.js, I‚Äôm quite happy with my technology decision. There‚Äôs so much to learn, and so much more room to grow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of July, I decided to change up my gym routine. I had been running a variation of the <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout">P.H.U.L. routine</a>, but decided I wanted to try something a little more intense since I felt like I was plateauing with both deadlifts and bench press.</p><p>I ended up choosing the <a href="https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/#Progression_for_Main_Lifts">nSuns 5 day routine</a> and so far, I‚Äôm really liking it. I haven‚Äôt gotten the chance yet to break through any of my plateaus as of yet, but I‚Äôm feeling stronger and putting up more volume than I have in a while.</p><p>This week is going to be a big test for that. I just beat my previous personal record (PR) in squats by squatting 260 lbs. which is 10 lbs. heavier than my previous PR of 250. I managed to finally do a single plate (135 lbs.) overhead press last week and will be trying for 140 this week. The real test will be days 4 and 5 this week when I attempt to break my PRs for both deadlifts and bench press by going for 320 lbs. on deadlifts and 215 lbs. on bench. Both are 5 lbs. heavier than my previous records.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know how exactly to compare this to previous routines since I only do one set of each at the heaviest weight when before I would do sets of 3 to 5, but I‚Äôm feeling better about it.</p><p>I also don‚Äôt know how much of this is just beginning the new routine and when I will inevitably stall a bit, but I‚Äôm taking it in stride. I feel like some of it is mental as well. As funny as it might sound, I feel like the routine is pushing me to exit my comfort zone and try heavier weights than I might normally attempt. This can of course be a little dangerous, but at the same time, it‚Äôs not doing it at such a steep jump to make it seem too impossible for me to do.</p><p>The only real downside to it so far is that my gym sessions went from just over an hour to sometimes over an hour and a half. This isn‚Äôt much of an issue, but it has been limiting my available time to run and do other cardio. I‚Äôm still hoping to hit 300 miles running this year, but right now, I‚Äôm starting to lag a bit in reaching it. I‚Äôm hoping to go on some longer runs over the weekend once the temperature becomes a little cooler.</p><p>All in all, I‚Äôm happy with my progress. My lifts are going up, my weight is coming down, and I feel better and healthier for it. I‚Äôm planning on keeping with this program for 12 weeks so I‚Äôll see what if any changes I‚Äôll make then.</p><p>Until then, I‚Äôll keep on grindin‚Äô!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last 12 weeks, I‚Äôve been running the <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout">P.H.U.L. Workout Routine</a>.</p><p>This is the first time I think I‚Äôve stuck with a routine that long without some tweaks here and there. I enjoyed the routine. It had me at the gym 4 days a week which gave me the other days to get some outdoor runs in. My gains haven‚Äôt been as fast as I have done in other programs, but I‚Äôm feeling stronger, and better about my progress.</p><p><strong>Bench Press:</strong> 200 lbs. ‚Üí 210 lbs.</p><p><strong>Squat:</strong> 230 lbs. ‚Üí 245 lbs.</p><p><strong>Deadlift:</strong> 305 lbs. ‚Üí 315 lbs.</p><p><strong>Overhead Press:</strong> 105 lbs. ‚Üí 115 lbs.</p><p>Like I said, the progress hasn‚Äôt been as fast as I have done in other routines, but I‚Äôm also not doing linear progression like I was before. I generally have been sticking with the weight for 2-3 sessions, increasing the reps each week before bumping up the weight. While the weight numbers haven‚Äôt gone up, the volume lifted each week per exercise generally has. Even more important, I feel better about my lifts each time through the cycle. That said, I have struggled upping my bench press and deadlift weights, but I‚Äôm hoping to move up some soon.</p><p>The only tweak I made early on was moving overhead press to my upper hypertrophy day. I was noticing that I was having problems with being able to bench heavy and OHP heavy the same day. Whichever one I did first I generally did well in, but whichever one came second, I struggled and often failed. I think this is also part of my troubles with deadlifts. I do deadlifts following my squats, and am wondering if that‚Äôs part of the reason.</p><p>I‚Äôm going to continue to do the P.H.U.L routine, but with some changes for the next 12 weeks. I‚Äôm going to move deadlifts to my lower hypertrophy day. I‚Äôm going to add Romanian Deadlifts to my lower power day in exchange, focusing more on volume than on weight. I‚Äôm also going to switch out barbell lunges for Bulgarian split squats. I‚Äôm hoping to continue to make progress, and see my lifts get heavier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two and a half months in, I figured I‚Äôd reflect on where things stand with regards towards working towards the goals I set for myself.</p><p>I feel pretty good with the progress I‚Äôve made so far. In some areas I could be better, but overall, I‚Äôve been happy with what I‚Äôve done so far this year.</p><h2>Losing Weight</h2><p>I‚Äôm down almost 10 pounds, so I figure that‚Äôs progress. My diet still needs work, but I feel I‚Äôm doing better now than I was before. The color coding I‚Äôve done for myself still slants towards red and yellow more than green, but I think some of that comes from not enough protein and too many carbs rather than calories. Either way though, I can do better.</p><p>I‚Äôve continued to do well with making it to the gym. I decided to change up programs a little bit. I‚Äôve moved away from the PPL program and have adopted the <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout">P.H.U.L.</a> program instead. My progression might end up getting a little slower, but hopefully I‚Äôll get stronger overall. I can happily say I‚Äôm benching more than 200 lbs. for the first time in my life. My squats and deadlifts are finally getting back up there after my groin injury so I‚Äôm hoping to continue making progress there.</p><h2>Read More</h2><p>I‚Äôve fallen behind in this one a little bit with regards to books. I‚Äôm only on my third book of the year, but I have been reading the news and other sources as well. I need to continue to force myself to bed earlier to get in some reading before I turn off the lights.</p><h2>Side Project</h2><p>I can actually say that I‚Äôve made progress on this. I don‚Äôt have much to show at the moment, but I finished the <a href="https://advancedreact.com/">Advanced React tutorial</a> I was working on and feel like I‚Äôm in a good place right now with it.</p><h2>Write More</h2><p>This one, I need to work on. I have a few ideas for posts, but need to find a good way to put them into words which is easier said than done. That said, I just need to sit down and do it.</p><p>I‚Äôm feeling good with where I‚Äôm at with my goals. There‚Äôs still plenty of year left, so hopefully I can make the most of it!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we‚Äôre now about 3 weeks into 2019, I figured I‚Äôd quickly see where I‚Äôm at in terms of my goals for the year.</p><h2>Losing Weight &amp; Improving Strength</h2><p>I‚Äôm down about 4 pounds so far, so that‚Äôs good. The bad is that I could still be a little stricter on what I eat. I have more good days than bad, but there‚Äôs still quite a bit in the middle I could improve on. I‚Äôm not about ready to completely give up burgers and the ‚Äúless-than-healthy‚Äù options, but my self control to turn away the cookie, or slack off and order a pizza is a little higher than I would have preferred. I also haven‚Äôt been the greatest at sticking to a dry January, but I‚Äôm still drinking less than I normally do, so I‚Äôll count that as a win.</p><p>In terms of my lifts at the gym, I finally crossed the 200 lbs. threshold on bench press, so I‚Äôm excited about that. Next bench press day, I‚Äôll be going for 205 lbs. for the first time ever. I‚Äôm currently doing 3 sets of 5 for deadlifts, so that‚Äôs stalled a bit at 295 lbs., but I generally feel like I‚Äôm getting stronger.</p><h2>Reading More</h2><p>I am about 2/3 through <em>The Forever War</em> by Dexter Filkins which would be my 2nd book of the year. I could read more I suppose, but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm on the right track.</p><h2>Working on my Side Project</h2><p>This one I‚Äôve made no progress on. I need to continue on with the tutorials. I really just need to set aside some time for it.</p><h2>Writing More</h2><p>I‚Äôve tried over the last couple of weeks to come up with an idea for a post or something to write, but so far I‚Äôve been drawing blanks or have started something only to just delete it because I feel it‚Äôs not worth continuing for whatever reason. Again, I should probably just set aside some time and write, even if whatever it is I‚Äôm writing never sees the light of day.</p><h2>Other Things I Have Been Doing</h2><p>Some of the things that I have done in the meantime is start catching back up on my video game backlog. I finally played through Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and have started FarCry 5. The Lost Legacy definitely is worth playing. It continues the Uncharted series fantastic gameplay and story telling. FarCry 5 has been a lot of fun so far as well, but I‚Äôm not that far into it. I‚Äôm going to try to keep working and hope to knock out some more games.</p><p>Moving on, I‚Äôm hoping to continue working towards my goals and hopefully make some progress on just about all of them. The first 3 weeks weren‚Äôt bad, but I think I can do better!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year later, let&#x27;s see what happened in 2018 and what I&#x27;m looking at for 2019.</p><h2>Looking Back at 2018</h2><p>Let&#x27;s look back at 2018 and see how I did with my goals.</p><h3>What I Wanted to Do</h3><h4>Lose Weight</h4><p>Unfortunately, no progress was really made on this front. I did shed a few pounds over the course of the year, but nothing to really write home about. That said, I did make progress in my lifts. I ended up hitting 315 lbs. on deadlifts, 250 lbs. on squats, 195 lbs. on bench press, and 130 lbs. on overhead press. A torn tendon in my groin has set my squats and deadlifts back a bit, but I&#x27;m working my way back up. I do feel like I&#x27;m in better shape but I could have done better.</p><h4>Reading More</h4><p>I did better with reading than I did with my fitness goals. I ended out the year reading a total of 13 books. I probably could have done better, but as I mentioned, I subscribed to <em>The Economist</em> which occupied some of my reading time as well. I think my three favorite books this year were</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079VDR6HM">The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States: A Speculative Novel</a> by Jeffrey Lewis</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1RRDMH">Shooting Ghosts: A U.S. Marine, a Combat Photographer, and Their Journey Back from War</a> by TJ Brennan &amp; Finbarr O&#x27;Reilly</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VTV2899">Vacationland</a> by John Hodgman.</li></ul><h4>Side Projects</h4><p>My recipe project has taken a pause right now as I was starting to struggle figuring out the best way to move forward with it. I decided to buy Wes Bos&#x27; <a href="https://advancedreact.com/">Advanced React &amp; GraphQL Course</a> in hopes of finding the best way to do things, and I have to say that it was just what I was looking for. I haven&#x27;t completed it yet, but it&#x27;s given me a lot more insight into React and something completely new with GraphQL. I&#x27;m hoping to finish it up soon and use what I&#x27;ve learned to build out my project.</p><h4>Write More</h4><p>This was a bust. Not much more can be said other than I just didn&#x27;t write nearly as much as I wanted.</p><h2>Moving onto 2019</h2><p>I&#x27;m going to stick with the same four goals for 2019.</p><h3>Lose Weight</h3><p>Over the last two months of 2018, I was very good at making sure to hit the gym almost daily. I&#x27;m going to continue to do that and move forward on my PPL (Pull, Push, Legs) routine. I&#x27;m also going to try to hold myself more accountable with my diet. I&#x27;ve created a spreadsheet to go along with my use of <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a> to help me with this. I&#x27;m color coding my calorie intake as well as my macros to help push me towards my goals. Three days in, and I already hate seeing numbers red. Fortunately most are green or yellow, but it&#x27;s a small sample size. I&#x27;m also going with a dry January. My alcohol intake isn&#x27;t excessive by any means, but I&#x27;m hoping that by kicking it out entirely, I can help shed some pounds in January and have the momentum carry over for the rest of the year.</p><p>With regards to fitness goals, I&#x27;m hoping to hit 400 lbs. on deadlifts, 275 lbs. on squats, 225 lbs. on bench press, and 150 lbs. on overhead press by the end of the year. I&#x27;d also like to hit the 300 mile mark running.</p><h3>Read More</h3><p>I&#x27;ve already finished one book this year (ok...ok...I started it in 2018), and I&#x27;m hoping to keep that going. I&#x27;m trying to mix the fiction in with the nonfiction to keep things interesting. My goal this year is 20-25 books, so hopefully I can reach that goal. I&#x27;ve done it before so I know it&#x27;s attainable.</p><h3>Side Project</h3><p>As I mentioned above, I made some good progress with my recipe project, but my limited knowledge with React and Node started to limit me getting further. The <a href="https://advancedreact.com/">Advanced React &amp; GraphQL Course</a> has been doing a great job helping me get my head around some of the more advanced areas, so once complete, I plan on moving forward. Hopefully, by the beginning of February I can get back to my project.</p><h3>Write More</h3><p>One of the biggest limiters I felt last year was trying to come up with what to write about, and how to put those ideas into words. I&#x27;m hoping to find ways of improving that this year, and maybe add some stream-of-consciousness posts as well.</p><p>Those are my four main goals of 2019. Here&#x27;s to hoping that I do better this year than last.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I finally pulled the trigger and completely removed Facebook from my life. I deleted my Facebook account in June or July, I forget which month, but I had kept my Instagram account. That ended this week when I downloaded my archive and deleted my Instagram account.</p><h2>What Finally Pushed Me Over the Edge</h2><p>This past week, the New York Times reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/technology/facebook-data-sharing.html">Facebook had given Amazon, Spotify, Royal Bank of Canada among others access to your private messages</a>. I wasn‚Äôt horribly surprised, but it finally gave me the final kick in the ass I needed to just click ‚Äòdelete‚Äô.</p><p>Now it would not surprise me to know that Facebook would do this, and it was probably buried in the permissions access that users granted to services such as Spotify. I had linked my Facebook account at one point to Spotify and it‚Äôs likely that I would have missed it as well. I also wouldn‚Äôt expect Spotify to need read access to my private messages, and I‚Äôd wager that others would think the same. I understand why it would need write access as I and others have shared tracks through Facebook Messenger, but why would Spotify need to read my messages...I can log into Facebook for that. So with all of that in mind, I decided the supposed benefits just weren‚Äôt worth it anymore and got rid of my account...permanently.</p><h2>What I‚Äôll Miss</h2><p>I think the two biggest things that I‚Äôll miss from Instagram would be seeing what my friends are up to and what the local craft breweries are releasing. It will kind of suck not having this anymore, but I‚Äôm just done with Facebook. I‚Äôve been more aware and active with regards to my privacy and I don‚Äôt trust Zuckerberg and company to make any correct decisions when it comes to keeping my data secure.</p><h2>My Privacy Kick</h2><p>Over the past year, I‚Äôve been focused more and more on protecting my privacy. I‚Äôve switched to Firefox over Chrome and have been migrating away from Google as well. Facebook was obviously an issue and I can say that it‚Äôs been dealt with as best as I can. I‚Äôll write up more on that later down the line, but for now, goodbye Facebook and good riddance!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I mentioned it before, but I‚Äôve been working on a new side project. I figured it was a good way to teach myself React and Node.js, much like OpenVoter taught me PHP. I‚Äôve been wanting to familiarize myself with some more modern frameworks, and I feel like Node and React are good places to start.</p><p>The project I‚Äôve been working on is called Digital Family Cookbook. It‚Äôs basically a cookbook web application meant for families. I know my wife and I have plenty of recipes, and it can often be a challenge to figure out where they‚Äôre saved. I‚Äôve saved a bunch within Google Drive, but I also have them in Evernote, and several other places. I figure a good project would be to make a website that I can centralize them in so if one of us needs to make dinner, we don‚Äôt have to remember where the recipe is or ask where it is.</p><p>I‚Äôve gotten plenty of false starts on this one. I originally wrote it in PHP 3+ years ago. I re-wrote it using Ruby on Rails shortly after and had it sort of up and running. That ended when I started having issues with my Rackspace server and realized that it was cheaper to host the sites I cared about on Amazon Web Services.</p><p>Shortly after that, my wife and I bought a house, so a lot of my time and resources went into housework (it never ends). But now that I have some time to breathe, I figured I‚Äôd jump back in and rebuild this as a learning project.</p><h2>The First Start</h2><p>I originally started the project to be a full fledged web application allowing for people to sign up for accounts and host it all for everyone. I decided to create 2 separate projects. One for the front end, and then one for the API on the back end. I figure I‚Äôd try to be ambitious and sort of plan ahead for potential mobile apps and writing the backend once for an API would probably make things easier down the road.</p><p>I was making a fair amount of progress on it. Learning some of the ins and outs of how React worked, as well as some of the intricacies of Node.js and the newer functionalities of JavaScript/ES6. I even had a rudimentary admin console all set up for administrators.</p><p>In the end though, I decided that I didn‚Äôt really have the time or desire to run a website publicly. I figured it‚Äôd be too time-consuming to make sure that spammers, scammers, and other bad actors weren‚Äôt abusing the application. My ambition for this project might‚Äôve been a little high, but I realized that to handle something like this was a little too much for my tastes at the moment.</p><h2>Starting Over</h2><p>I still liked the idea of the app, but figured I‚Äôd go with a scaled down version. I‚Äôd basically make it more along the lines of a downloadable CMS rather than a centrally run site. I‚Äôd open source it much like OpenVoter, and just let others download it and run it on their own server if they want. I have no idea if anyone will, but figure why not? It solves a problem for me, maybe it could solve a problem for someone else.</p><p>Fortunately, I was able to use what I already wrote as a guide for the new version of the project. I‚Äôm still going with 2 projects, the web portion, and then the API. My ambitions might be scaled back, but they aren‚Äôt so scaled back as to not think I won‚Äôt want to write a mobile application for the cookbook.</p><p>My initial version of the new app used Bootstrap for the UI, but after listening to several software development podcasts talking about the virtues of CSS Grid and other more modern CSS tools, I decided that I might as well go with my own custom CSS code. I figure it can‚Äôt hurt, the few tutorials I did on CSS Grid showed me how powerful it can be and I already have a few ideas on how I want to integrate it.</p><p>That‚Äôs basically where I am now. I have the skeleton of the app laid out and now I‚Äôm writing more code and making progress. For the first time in a while, I actually feel good with where I‚Äôm at with it. There‚Äôs still plenty to do, but now I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like I‚Äôm flailing around trying to find solid ground to start off on.</p><p>I‚Äôll try to write more updates on the journey I‚Äôm taking writing this app as it progresses towards completion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Monday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal">Microsoft bought GitHub for a whopping $7.5 billion</a>.</p><p>Naturally, given how much the open source community uses GitHub, this caused quite the uproar. There were views from all across the spectrum. Some were saying that it was awful, while others were more optimistic about it. Elsewhere in the community, it has gone so far that GitLab, one of GitHub‚Äôs bigger competitors, even saw a <a href="https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1">large spike of project imports</a>, likely because of the acquisition. I know I saw somewhere that SourceForge was even trying to court devs to move their projects to their platform.</p><p>I‚Äôll admit, my initial reaction to the news was along the lines of ‚Äúuh oh‚Äù.</p><p>Having several days to ruminate on it though, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm nearly as pessimistic as I used to be. I‚Äôd actually say that I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic. Microsoft definitely has had their share of acquisitions turning into horrors (see Skype), but the current Microsoft is quite different compared to the Microsoft of old.</p><p>Microsoft has the reputation, and rightly earned, of being hostile towards open source and the open source community. They have quite a lot of past bad acts to make up for. That said, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft since 2014, has generally done a pretty good job with regards to the developer community. Microsoft has embraced the open source community, even going so far as to allow you to run Linux within Windows 10. Their .NET architecture even runs on Windows, MacOS, &amp; Linux. I‚Äôm hopeful that with these changes, they can make GitHub even stronger for developers.</p><p>Now, my optimism doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt have my concerns. Microsoft is a large company and they have their own version control system (VCS) in Team Foundation Server (TFS) that mirrors a lot of what Git and GitHub do. Git is of course not part of this acquisition, but it is the VCS that GitHub is built off of. My hope is that Microsoft keeps the two separate for the most part. Let the better parts of each system rub off on each other, but I don‚Äôt want to see any improvements of GitHub abandoned or semi-abandoned in favor of TFS.</p><p>It‚Äôs still way to early to make any real judgements. It could be a year or more before the effects become noticeable. I‚Äôm going to keep my cautious optimism, and withhold my judgement for the time being. I‚Äôd encourage you to do the same.</p><h3>One More Note</h3><p>I‚Äôll say this though, the acquisition has created plenty of new memes in the development community ranging from bringing back Clippy to making fun of the constant annoying prompts to restart your computer for updates. It‚Äôs given me a few laughs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you can tell, I&#x27;ve decided to give my blog a little bit of a facelift.</p><p>The primary reason I decided to do this was that I realized I basically made my posts dependent upon having an image for every blog post, and in some cases, limited how long the opening of my posts could be. If I didn&#x27;t make it fall within these constraints, the alignment of the boxes would end up being off. It wasn&#x27;t really a long-term solution that worked. I decided that a redesign was in order.</p><p>I&#x27;m definitely happy with how this design came out. I had a sidebar a little while back, and decided that I&#x27;d go back to a sidebar design. I searched around Dribble and other blogs I follow to see what others have done to try to come up with something for me.</p><p>I decided to go with a sticky sidebar. I figured that if it wasn&#x27;t sticky, you&#x27;d have a bunch of dead space on the left of the page once you scrolled down. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of that so I made the sidebar stick to the side of the page so at least it wasn&#x27;t blank.</p><p>On mobile, the sidebar slims down and becomes the header. I was slightly concerned that too much of the main page would end up cut off from the header. In the end, outside the iPhone SE, enough below the header was visible that I decided that the design would work.</p><p>I might end up doing something different for the photography page, but I like the way the design turned out for the blog portion of my site.</p><p>I think another, probable less glamorous part of it is that I can never seem to stick with a design. After a while, I just want to dig in and redesign it. I wish I would end up spending more time writing posts rather than re-writing the code behind it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last post, I was saying that I was going to attempt an experiment in how I got my news. I decided to turn off Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. Instead of them, I opted for utilizing my subscriptions to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and The Economist. I also ended up using RSS feeds as well.</p><h2>So How Did It Go?</h2><p>I think the best word to explain how it went would be mixed. I stayed off Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, but I probably focused too much on staying up to date with my RSS feeds rather than much more periodic views of my NYT, WSJ &amp; Economist subscriptions. If I were to do this again, I would probably do more to limit how often I check my RSS feeds. I also visited Hacker News a little more often than I could have. I didn‚Äôt end up reading much of The Economist, and instead was focused on books.</p><h2>What Did I Miss?</h2><p>I think the only thing I missed was Twitter. The funny thing is that I can‚Äôt really pinpoint the exact reason I missed Twitter. I missed being able to Tweet about and read others‚Äô Tweets about hockey games. This was particularly amplified by the start of the Stanley Cup Playoffs and watching my team, the Philadelphia Flyers make it in and play (and subsequently lose 4-2 to the Penguins). But other than that, I think I just enjoy just the general brevity of Twitter.</p><h2>Moving Forward</h2><p>The news did seem to slow down some for me. I didn‚Äôt always know what was going on all the time, and I feel fine about that. I did pick up the big things from my RSS feeds and NYT &amp; WSJ newsletters, but didn‚Äôt feel bombarded by some of the news that came and went without consequence. I have to say I did like that. I do want to stay informed, but being able to let go a little from the constant onslaught was worth it.</p><p>I think the big takeaway from this for me is to get my news fixes at a slower pace. I also believe this can be done even with social media. When social media is involved, I just think you need to keep in mind who you follow. I‚Äôve unfollowed most of my non-friends on Facebook so just about all of the posts I see are from my friends. The people and accounts I follow on my primary Twitter account (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/kpwags">@kpwags</a>) definitely assists in this as I‚Äôve culled out most of the news sources to make it generally more enjoyable. I have a second account that follows more of the news sources for when I want to read them. I might also start to work with my lists on Twitter as well.</p><p>It was definitely a worthwhile exercise and I think I‚Äôm going to try to apply some of what I‚Äôve found towards how I browse through the news.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back, I read an article in the New York Times by Farhad Manjoo about how he switched to reading newspapers instead of getting his news from Social Media.</p><p>The piece was titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html">For Two Months, I Got My News From Print Newspapers. Here‚Äôs What I Learned</a>. While there was some controversy as Farhad had posted on social media at times during the two months, I like the idea he had. For a little more details about the controversy, you can hear an interview with Farhad Manjoo and Bob Garfield in an <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/did-farhad-unplug">On The Media Podcast Extra</a> discussing the matter.</p><p>I thought Farhad had an interesting take on it, and he made a good point about the speed of news when your primary source is Twitter and other social media sites. I&#x27;ve culled my main Twitter account of most news and politics accounts, primarily focusing on technology, science, software development and other &quot;lighter&quot; topics. My experience on Twitter has become better since doing so, but even with my best intentions, plenty of news and politics still makes it into my feed.</p><p>I&#x27;m thinking that I want to give this a try myself. But given costs, I think I&#x27;m going to forego the paper copies of newspapers and focus on the digital versions. I currently have a digital subscription to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal. I also receive The Economist weekly. I figure given time constraints, I&#x27;ll open the apps or websites a few times a day and read what&#x27;s happening. It might not be quite the same as the paper edition, but should still slow things down a bit. I&#x27;m planning on trying to try this for the month of April.</p><p>During this time, I will not be on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit. I&#x27;ll still peruse Hacker News and I&#x27;ll still be on Instagram. I figure I don&#x27;t use Instagram for news, so it&#x27;s no big deal there. Hacker News tends to focus more on tech and software development which will probably be less represented in sources such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. I&#x27;m still planning on following my RSS feeds as well, but I haven&#x27;t completely made up my mind there. I also plan to continue to listen to podcasts which will also help keep me up to date on the news.</p><p>My primary reason for doing this is to see what it&#x27;s like to get news on a &quot;slower&quot; basis. I doubt I&#x27;ll leave Twitter and Reddit forever and they certainly have their place. But for the month of April, I feel like it would be a good experiment to see how it goes.</p><p>I&#x27;ll update after April to let you know how it goes and if I was able to stick to my plan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So last Friday night, I was able to do something that I&#x27;ve been dreaming of for a while. I was able to skate outdoors on an ice rink in Hershey, Pennsylvania.</p><p>The weekend prior, the AHL (American Hockey League, or the NHL minor league) held their version of the Winter Classic, the AHL Outdoor Classic. It was played outdoors at Hershey Park Stadium and was a matchup of the Hershey Bears hosting the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. Since the Phantoms are the Flyers&#x27; minor league affiliate, Lauren and I bought tickets to see the game. It was a pretty cool experience watching hockey outdoors. I just wish that I got tickets a little higher up so we could see a little bit more of the action. Happily, the Phantoms won 5-2.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjA0OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMDQ4IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Skating Outdoors" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Skating Outdoors" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey%2F2018-ahl-outdoor-classic.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey%2F2018-ahl-outdoor-classic.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey%2F2018-ahl-outdoor-classic.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>Because they already built the outdoor rink, they decided to make some money by opening it up to the public to rent out. Reddit&#x27;s Flyers subreddit set up a 2 hour pickup game on the ice last Friday and I was able to participate.</p><p>Stepping out onto the field was a surreal experience. I&#x27;ve been playing hockey for almost 5 years now, but there really is something about skating around in the open air. The pickup game was a lot of fun. The ice wasn&#x27;t as good as I was expecting or hoping as it had been up for a week with some 50-60¬∫F weather. Either way though, it was an amazing experience that I still can&#x27;t fully believe I participated in. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, even just skating around outside would be worth it.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTUzNiIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNTM2IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Skating Outdoors" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Skating Outdoors" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey%2Foutdoor-skating.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey%2Foutdoor-skating.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2018-01-29-outdoor-hockey%2Foutdoor-skating.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A year later, let&#39;s see what happened in 2017 and what I&#39;m looking at for 2018.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year later, let&#x27;s see what happened in 2017 and what I&#x27;m looking at for 2018.</p><h2>Looking Back at 2017</h2><p>2017 has been an interesting year to say the least. My productivity has definitely been hampered by what&#x27;s been going on in Washington D.C. and Trump&#x27;s presidency. I know I shouldn&#x27;t let it affect me as much as it has, but at the same time, I can&#x27;t say that it hasn&#x27;t. So many of his actions have made my blood boil to the point that I become distracted, and in some cases, full of despair. Not that I can use this as an excuse for things I didn&#x27;t accomplish, but like other people, I can&#x27;t always throw current events to the back of my mind.</p><p>I wish I could say I was successful at accomplishing my goals for 2017 that I laid out <a href="https://kpwags.com/life/2017/01/24/goals-for-2017.html">previously</a>. At the end of the day though, I didn&#x27;t completely hit any of them. Despite this, 2017 was not a bad year.</p><h3>2017 Goals Post-Mortem</h3><h4>Getting Into Shape</h4><p>This one I did make progress on. I didn&#x27;t really make much progress on the weight-front, but I was able to get my strength and conditioning up. My core lifts have gone up, I feel like I have more &quot;umph&quot; when skating and running. I was also able to run Broad Street (The popular 10 miler) in May, finishing with a time of 1 hour, 34 minutes which was just under my goal of 1:35.</p><h4>Reading More Books</h4><p>Last year I ended up reading 13 books which was below what I was hoping for, but it did end up being more than 2016. A couple of years ago when I could read over my lunch break did wonders for increasing the amount I read. I feel like I kind of shot too high, too early.</p><h4>Enjoying the Outdoors</h4><p>Yeah, I failed at this one. Didn&#x27;t do anything towards this one. Maybe this year.</p><h4>Getting Back into My Side Projects</h4><p>This one I can sort of say I&#x27;ve done. I haven&#x27;t gone full bore into it, but I&#x27;ve been slowly reading into React and Node.js trying to learn their basics for my next project. Javascript isn&#x27;t so much an issue as much as wrapping my head around some of the newer methods of doing things. I learned PHP using OpenVoter, so hopefully I can have similar success with this.</p><h4>Writing More</h4><p>Sadly, this is another one I haven&#x27;t done all that much of. I&#x27;ve had a bunch of ideas for posts that I started, but I never ended up finishing them. Maybe this year I can re-visit some of them or actually follow through more of my ideas.</p><h4>Becoming More Involved in Politics</h4><p>Yeah, didn&#x27;t do much on this either. I attended one meeting of the local Democrats in January or February, but never really followed up. I&#x27;m still interested, but I also need to beat back my cynicism and my feelings of just being jaded.</p><h4>Disconnect a Little</h4><p>I moved away from Facebook. I haven&#x27;t deleted my account yet, but I don&#x27;t really visit it anymore. I culled who I follow on Twitter and have tried to avoid too much politics within my feed. It&#x27;s not completely free of politics, but I do generally find it more enjoyable.</p><hr/><h2>Onward to 2018</h2><h3>Goals</h3><p>I think I&#x27;m going to keep it a little more simple this year and focus on only four goals.</p><h4>Losing the Weight (Finally)</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest time honored traditions. People committing to losing weight January 1st, and then forgetting about it February 1st. I&#x27;m hoping to continue with this goal this year. Unfortunately, this did hit a little bit of a snag 2 weeks in as I ended up breaking the tip of my finger at the gym with a 55 lb. dumbbell...oops! Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I had feared and only ended up missing 2 hockey games and 2 weeks of strength training.</p><p>My gym routine has been tweaked some more and you can view it, as well as my progress <a href="https://kpwags.com/gym-routine/">here</a>. I try to keep it updated as much as possible given that I&#x27;ve been known to tweak it from time to time. I think part of that is me always wanting to try new things.</p><h4>Reading</h4><p>This year might be a little bit more of a challenge as well because I ended up re-subscribing to <em>The Economist</em> which is a fantastic source of news, but very in depth and not exactly a fast read. I&#x27;m trying to keep a balance between reading my books and the magazine. My <a href="https://kpwags.com/reading-list/">reading list</a> has been a little more focused on non-fiction lately and probably will for the near future. I love a good story, but have been enjoying learning more about history, the world, and other people&#x27;s experiences.</p><h4>Side Projects</h4><p>I&#x27;m going to continue to work on my new project using Node.js &amp; React. I&#x27;ve spent a decent chunk over the last week or so, so hopefully this will continue. Despite me knowing Javascript, I&#x27;ve found that Node.js has proven a challenge for me. I&#x27;m hoping that with more focus, I can get my head around some of the new concepts and really start to make progress. I have a lot of ideas for the project and would love to be able to start to implement them and get the site off the ground.</p><h4>Write More</h4><p>Let&#x27;s try this one again. I&#x27;m kind of hoping that given my separation of politics away from this blog and onto it&#x27;s <a href="https://politics.kpwags.com">own site</a> that I might be more willing to write what&#x27;s on my mind without inundating this blog. Plus, maybe that will help me with some frustrations of what&#x27;s going on in the government. I&#x27;m currently working on another 1,000+ word post on getting back into gaming with a review of DOOM. So keep your eyes peeled for that.</p><h4>Everything Else in 2018</h4><p>All too often last year, I felt like I was too busy or that I had too much going on. I&#x27;m hoping that this year is a little more calm. That said, the first month of the year hasn&#x27;t exactly lived up to that, and my schedule for February and March isn&#x27;t getting much calmer.</p><p>Some of the other things I&#x27;ve been working on and will continue to work on include:</p><ul><li><strong>Homebrewing:</strong> After Christmas, I started brewing my first beer. I just recently bottled it, so in about 2-3 weeks, I&#x27;ll find out if it&#x27;s any good. I&#x27;m hoping to continue brewing from time to time.</li><li><strong>Video Games:</strong> My Steam backlog alone is huge. I&#x27;m planning on trying to play through a bunch of them and mark them as beaten. I might even write a post here and there about some of the newer, better ones.</li><li><strong>House Projects:</strong> My plan is to keep up with the multitude of projects around the house. <em>Buy a house they said, it will be fun they said</em>. All jokes aside, while it can be a pain in the ass sometimes, it&#x27;s nice to have a house to call my own and have a yard.</li></ul><p>Here&#x27;s to a better 2018.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Sunday night, like many Star Trek fans sat down to watch the premiere of Star Trek: Discovery.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday night, like many Star Trek fans sat down to watch the premiere of Star Trek: Discovery.</p><p>This is the first new Star Trek series since Enterprise was cancelled back in 2005. 12 years us Trekkies sat with no new Trek on TV. We got some action movies in Star Trek, Into Darkness &amp; Beyond, but nothing like The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine or Voyager.</p><p>I knew once Enterprise was cancelled that the chances of a new series coming out anytime in the near future was just about slim to none. When I heard that they were rebooting Star Trek I was hopeful that a successful movie might allow for a new series. No such luck. It wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal for me anyway as I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the biggest fan of the new movies. They‚Äôre not bad movies, but none of them really speak to me the same way the TV series did or how any of the previous movies spoke to me. The thing that really drew, and still does draw me to Star Trek is the hopeful vision of the future. The new movies focus more on the action aspect of things. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy the action; it‚Äôs just not what really draws me to it.</p><p>Fast forward to this past weekend with the premiere of Discovery. I watched the first episode and left with a feeling of...well, indifference. I didn‚Äôt hate it by any means. The special effects were fantastic. The story wasn‚Äôt bad, but I‚Äôm not sure how much of it I really got in just one episode. As it stands, I wasn‚Äôt truly drawn in. Star Trek TV series often have this problem though. The first seasons of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager were definitely each series‚Äô weakest seasons. I also don‚Äôt think you can really judge any television series based on a single episode, especially the pilot.</p><p>This leads me to my dilemma. Star Trek: Discovery is only available on CBS All-Access. CBS All-Access costs $6 or $10 a month depending on if you‚Äôre willing to tolerate ads. Unlike the other shows on CBS, Discovery will not be broadcast past the first episode.</p><p>On one hand, I want to support Star Trek and the development of future seasons and series. The special effects for Discovery were impressive. They definitely felt better than previous series which can probably be attributed to both newer technology as well as a bigger budget. I want to support this and the development of more Trek on TV and a subscription should hopefully allow for it.</p><p>But on the other hand, I absolutely hate what CBS is pulling and don‚Äôt want to support it. I can‚Äôt think of any franchise that has the same pull that Star Trek does on both television and the movies. CBS knows this and is taking full advantage. How many other new shows do you think CBS (or any network) could put behind a paywall and expect the numbers of subscribers to be there? This irritates me to no end and I definitely feel taken advantage of. I figure Discovery will probably face increased piracy because of this. I won‚Äôt go that far, but I also haven‚Äôt ruled out waiting until next summer when all 15 episodes are out, getting the one week free trial, binging all the episodes and then cancelling my subscription. I also feel like CBS is basically torpedoing the series by making us Star Trek fans consider going down this route.</p><p>I also can‚Äôt help but wonder if this is the future of TV and streaming. All the different stations offering their own streaming service. We‚Äôve already seen the beginning of it with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon getting exclusives. We‚Äôve seen a first hint with Disney planning their own streaming service in the next couple of years. Imagine having to pay \$5-10 each for every channel you want to stream. I‚Äôm sure this is part of their plans to try to make those planning to cut the cord think twice about it. But imagine if ABC, NBC, Comedy Central, and others each made you buy into their own services in addition to cable and broadcast like CBS is doing. (Now they can get double the payments!) The costs are going to add up fast. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon at least add more value due to their diverse and large selection of TV series and movies. CBS doesn‚Äôt even provide full access to their back catalogue.</p><p>I still haven‚Äôt decided what I‚Äôm going to do about Discovery and CBS All-Access. I might very well just suck it up and buy the subscription to watch the series, or I might just wait until the end and binge watch it. Either way, I‚Äôm not sure I like where the future of streaming is heading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Recently, much has changed in regards to my presence on social media.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, much has changed in regards to my presence on social media.</p><p>Back in February I decided that I had had enough of Facebook and left the service. I didn‚Äôt deactivate or delete my account, I simply signed out and deleted the apps from my phone &amp; tablet. Suffice it to say, I have yet to look back.</p><p>I had several reasons for making this decision.</p><h3>Privacy</h3><p>Facebook is of course known for the fact that they do everything they can to grab every bit of information about you. They find out who your friends are, what you like to eat, what you like to drink, your political views, and so much more. The scary thing, and this is by no means limited to Facebook, Google does it too, is that you don‚Äôt even have to be explicit about it. Facebook can figure out so much that all the little hints that you drop along the way in what you like and share can give it away. There was a story several years ago where <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#3078e64b6668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target found out someone was pregnant before her father even found out</a>. Think about that, and then imagine something far more detailed, and far more invasive. I‚Äôm still on Instagram though, which is owned by Facebook. The privacy thing still bothers me there, but privacy alone isn‚Äôt the only reason I left.</p><h3>Echo Chamber</h3><p>Facebook‚Äôs algorithm gets a lot of press on how it really tailors what we all see and read about to our tastes. Facebook generally wants to keep us on the site, so showing us too many articles that we disagree with can end up hurting that goal. The problem that arises from that, is that when it comes to politics and ideas, we might only see those thoughts and ideas that correspond with our own rather than challenge us. I‚Äôm certainly sometimes guilty of too quickly writing off conflicting ideas as simply being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù without looking at the meat of the argument. To not even be given the other viewpoints though ends up weakening the dialogue.</p><p>The other side of this is that we as humans tend to stick with people we agree with. It‚Äôs natural to do this. The downside here though is that all too often, it shows in the feeds. Even without Facebook‚Äôs algorithm, we still only see our side of the argument.</p><p>Given that my Facebook profile has content that I really don‚Äôt want strangers to have easy access to (I keep most things private on Facebook), becoming friends with people outside my social circle isn‚Äôt an option to get alternate views, and if I wanted to follow right-leaning publications, there are better places to do it than on Facebook. Before I left Facebook, I culled my likes and follow list to essentially just friends, not really pages and groups. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say there is that I don‚Äôt really feel like using Facebook as a news aggregator, more as a way to keep up with my friends and family.</p><p>One last thing on this point, Christie Aschwanden, a writer for FiveThirtyEight had a great point on how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/leaving-social-media-taught-me-how-broken-the-news-cycle-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media sort of points you in the direction of what to read</a>. Reading the news more like the morning paper rather than whatever your friends recommend has so far seemed to help me see more sides to things that I had been previously. Nothing‚Äôs perfect mind you as even publications like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal can try to funnel you into various stories, more often than not, you‚Äôll see a lot more than you would through social media.</p><h3>Time Sink</h3><p>Let‚Äôs face it, social media is a huge time sink. Many people, myself included, spend so much time following their feeds on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. I noticed I was spending far too much time on Facebook. It wasn‚Äôt the only thing on my phone or laptop I was wasting time on, but it was definitely the biggest.</p><h3>Beyond Facebook</h3><p>After I left Facebook, I also ended up spending less time on Reddit as well. The one site I ended up moving a little bit more to was Twitter. At the time I justified it by following some right-leaning accounts and news sources, but it ended up being somewhat of a time sink as well. All the politics drained me as well, so in mid-June, I ended up leaving Twitter as well. The only two social media platforms I really visited with any regularity were Instagram and Hacker News. I love photography and technology so both of those fit in for what I was looking for without much of the other stuff that ends up tagging along with Facebook and Twitter.</p><h3>Going Forward</h3><p>I still have no interest in returning to Facebook. Given that it‚Äôs still a connection to friends and family, I don‚Äôt see myself deactivating or deleting my account, but I‚Äôm not going to be logging on. As for Reddit, I still occasionally peruse the site, but the apps are gone from my iPad and phone, and I don‚Äôt spend that much time there. Recently, I decided to really cull who I follow on Twitter. Outside of a VERY small handful of people, I stopped following all news &amp; politics accounts regardless of what political leaning they had. Basically I‚Äôm trying to keep my Twitter feed to science, tech, development, sports, and beer feeds. While I‚Äôve only been back for a handful of days at this point, I have to say it feels more enjoyable than being inundated with the latest happenings of Washington. I still like to keep up with what‚Äôs going on, but I think I‚Äôll use podcasts and my subscription to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal to help me out there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last couple months have been really hectic for me and unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get much done on my recipe side project.</p><p>I ended up getting a fair amount in using Ruby on Rails 5.1, but never was really able to really get a rhythm going and am still not sure that I want to write it in Rails.</p><p>This past weekend I decided I really wanted to get back into it. It might not have been the best weekend as I had a graduation party Saturday night and a Phillies game Sunday with the family, but on Friday after work I decided I was going to sit down and look into React.</p><p>Looking at React made me realize that outside of work, I might have fallen behind some with where things currently are in the world of software and web development. For the last several years, all I‚Äôve really done are some basic websites and stuff for my jobs in the .NET world. I haven‚Äôt really dug into a side project or kept up which can definitely be harmful for software developers.</p><p>Looking at my calendar, the month of August thankfully doesn‚Äôt look too busy. I‚Äôm hoping that I can spend some evenings digging into several new (to me) languages and technologies. My plan to start is to look at ES6, React &amp; Node.js. I figure others might pop up during my exploration so I‚Äôll just have to see where I wind up.</p><p>Back to this past weekend‚Ä¶</p><p>On Friday, I ended up starting out with the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html" title="Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial</a> on React‚Äôs official site. I‚Äôm still getting used to the syntax and some of the new functionality of ES6, but I think I‚Äôm beginning to understand the basics of how it works. I still have a ways to go before I‚Äôm ready to really start developing, but sometimes the first step is the hardest. I think this is basically is my problem. I‚Äôm overwhelmed by how far it seems I‚Äôve fallen behind, and am struggling to take that first step up the ladder to climb out of this little hole.</p><p>I‚Äôm confident that if I put my mind to things, I can do it, I just have to avoid the distractions that pop up and really focus. I still want to do my recipe site, but I might end up writing it in something other than Rails depending on how this all goes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve been having an itch lately to get working on a new side project.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;ve been having an itch lately to get working on a new side project.</p><p>A little over a year ago I built a recipe site for Lauren and I to use to try to consolidate all our recipes. Our recipes are mixed around between Evernote, Google Drive, and random browser bookmarks. It isn‚Äôt the most efficient system and when once of us ends up cooking, it‚Äôs not always easy to remember where the recipe is stored. I built a little tool using Ruby on Rails and deployed it. It worked, but it was kind of clunky, not all that pretty, and rather quickly I forgot about it.</p><p>The initial version was primarily meant to be a down and dirty version of it. Get it to work and then optimize it and make it better later. I even built it with the idea that people could download it and install it on their own servers if they like. While there are other services out there, it‚Äôd be nice to know that you control the data &amp; recipes so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about the services shutting down and all your saved recipes go out the window. If you hadn‚Äôt guessed, the improvements never ended up happening. The code worked, but that was about the extent of it. It also didn‚Äôt help that Lauren and I ended up buying a house and had project after project lined up, which took up much of our time. So now I‚Äôm looking into reviving the project. I ended up shutting down the server it was running on, and I‚Äôm pretty much just going to throw out the old code and start fresh.</p><p>I built a quick outline of it in Ruby on Rails 5.1, but I also haven‚Äôt fully committed to using Ruby on Rails. It has been a long time since I really had a side project to work on. My last big side project was OpenVoter, the Digg-clone CMS. I built that using PHP, which on a side note, was actually how I learned PHP. Since then, I haven‚Äôt really done much development outside of work where I develop in the .NET stack with some Javascript as well. Part of me feels overwhelmed looking at what platforms and libraries are out there between React, Node.js, Angular.js, and countless others. I‚Äôve been battling my urge to go all gung-ho into this and to also do research into the different options to see what would be best. I also haven‚Äôt decided whether I want the whole project to be a CMS to download and install like before, or whether I want to do the platform route. My inclination is to continue the route of making it downloadable and installable on private servers like before, but the social aspect of allowing a central server is appealing.</p><p>Either way, over the next couple of months, I‚Äôm hoping to get some work done on it and hopefully nailing down how I‚Äôm going to build it, what languages and frameworks I‚Äôm going to use, and maybe even a working prototype. Stay tuned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2016 was super busy for me and I really am hoping that 2017 is not quite as busy.</p><p>I have set some goals for myself this year and am hoping to at least be able to make some progress on them.</p><h3>Continue to Get in Shape</h3><p>2016 was a year full of mixed results in my fitness goals. It was the first year since at least 2012 that I didn‚Äôt run a single race. No 5k, no half-marathon, no nothing. I was supposed to run a 15k and a 10 miler, but the weather was awful and rainy (I HATE the rain) both days so I just decided to forego the races. In terms of my weight and body fat percentage, I really didn‚Äôt make any progress with either, which was my own fault. I never really was able to get my meal plans working. I was able to increase my main lifts though so it wasn‚Äôt a horrible year.</p><p>I‚Äôm going to make a concerted effort to do better with my diet and of course continue to hit the gym and go for runs and bike rides. If I can really push myself to stick with my diet, I think I‚Äôll do better this year. In terms of races, I‚Äôm probably going to aim for a couple 5k races and a half-marathon or two. I‚Äôd like to beat my 2:15 half marathon record. Maybe I‚Äôll try to do the Philly Half-Marathon this year.</p><h3>Read More Books</h3><p>Last year I ended up subscribing to <em>The Economist</em> magazine. The magazine was a fantastic weekly source of news and what‚Äôs going on in the world, but its also time consuming to read. It kept my book reading time down and I‚Äôm hoping to get back into books. I‚Äôm currently on book 4 of <em>The Expanse</em> series by James SA Corey and I have to say it‚Äôs a fantastic series, and a good show (the few episodes I‚Äôve seen). I still subscribe to <em>National Geographic</em>, and I haven‚Äôt completely ruled out resubscribing to <em>The Economist</em>, but for now, I think I want to stick with books. I recently put together around 30 books I want to read, with many more behind it. I would like to hit 25 books this year so we shall see.</p><h3>Enjoy the Great Outdoors</h3><p>Growing up, I was in Boy Scouts and made Eagle Scout as well. But having moved away from my scout troop for college and having settled a little too far to really stay involved in the troop, I haven‚Äôt spent much time hiking, camping, and enjoying the great outdoors. I‚Äôve only gone on two hikes in the last 5-6 years. Once to the Pinnacle in Hamburg, PA, and the other to Ricketts Glen State Park near Wilkes Barre, PA. My trip up to Vermont in both July and October made me miss the outdoors so I‚Äôm hoping to be able to make it out this year to do more camping trips. I have a lot of the basic gear from my Scouting days so I might see if Lauren or someone else would want to go enjoy the great outdoors. I might look for a local Boy Scout Troop to volunteer with too.</p><h3>Get Back Into My Side Projects</h3><p>After college, I started developing OpenVoter as a side project, and while it might not have exactly taken off (not that I was hugely surprised), I really enjoyed being able to spend some of my time working on it. Since then, I haven‚Äôt done much outside of my blog and a few little things here and there. I have some ideas for some new projects, so I‚Äôd like to spend some time delving into the details and see which, if any I want to pursue. I might also delve more into Node.js and see if it makes sense to use that for anything.</p><h3>Write More</h3><p>I didn‚Äôt write that much at all last year which was kind of disappointing. That said, I‚Äôm hoping to to change that this year. If I can do one, maybe two posts a month, I think that will be good. I have some other things I might want to write as well so we‚Äôll see how it goes this year.</p><h3>Become a Little More Involved with Politics</h3><p>I don‚Äôt really completely know how to word this one. Anyone who knows me or follows me on Twitter, knows that I definitely slant liberal and do not like the fact that Donald Trump won the presidency. I feel his election is problematic for a whole host of reasons that would be a post in and of itself. My goal this year is to get involved, at least at a local level and as Ghandi put it, ‚ÄúBe the change that you wish to see in the world.‚Äù I‚Äôve made several calls to my representatives and senators to make my voice heard. I‚Äôve never done that before. I sent the occasional email for some issues, but I‚Äôve never been so angry and motivated to make sure my representatives know how I feel (respectfully of course). I‚Äôm not sure what that involvement will include at the moment, but I know someone in the local Democratic Party, so my plan is to talk to him and see what I can do.</p><h3>Disconnect a Little</h3><p>All too often, I pick up my phone and mindlessly browse Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, or something else. My goal this year is to disconnect some. I deleted Facebook &amp; Reddit from my phone and will hopefully stick with that. I‚Äôve toyed with the idea of deactivating my Facebook account, but for the time being, I think I‚Äôll just stick to browsing it once in a while on my laptop, desktop or tablet. Essentially just get it off of the device in my pocket.</p><p>Suffice it to say, I‚Äôm going to try to be a little ambitious this year. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be 100% successful in everything, but I figure if I can hit bits and pieces of each one, I‚Äôll be happy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2016 was a super busy year for me, and in some cases, probably a little too busy.</p><p>The year started off alright, enjoying the &quot;new house&quot; feeling, still thinking that hey, I&#x27;m a homeowner now! (It&#x27;s amazing that even a year after closing, it&#x27;s still kind of hard to believe I own a home).</p><p>In January, we had our only significant snowfall of the year and season. And I have to say, it was a pretty sight, especially when I didn&#x27;t have to clear the driveway. But I guess that&#x27;s why I bought a snow blower.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNjAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Snow" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Snow" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fsnow.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fsnow.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>In February, my wife and I discovered that our dining room had wood paneling behind the wallpaper which threw a wrench in our plans of taking down the wallpaper and painting plans. Our whole house was wallpapered, which isn&#x27;t really our style, but taking down wallpaper, while a major pain in the ass, isn&#x27;t exactly difficult. Painting would definitely give it a freshening up that isn&#x27;t terribly expensive. All the other rooms look 100x better now than they did the day we closed on the house.</p><p>The dining room was an addition to the house I want to say in the 1970s sometime, and we knew the walls weren&#x27;t plaster like the rest of the house (a simple knock on the wall told us that much). But we had (falsely) assumed that it was drywall underneath the wallpaper. Oh boy. Thinking about it, knowing we would have to do something, we decided we were going to tear down the wood paneling, and while we were at it, vault the ceiling. The dining room ceiling was no higher than 7 foot, so it felt cramped. If we were going to tear out the walls, we might as well raise the ceiling too.</p><p>In mid-March, the demolition began.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxODAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Dining Room Demolition" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Dining Room Demolition" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fdiningroomdemo.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fdiningroomdemo.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>To our surprise, the studs on the ceiling were these gorgeous reclaimed wood beams.

The only thing we can figure is the previous owner built the addition with whatever materials he either had on him or could get cheapest. The next 9 months, pretty much right up to Christmas, was spent renovating the dining room. We had to re-stud the walls, run all new wire, insulate, drywall and spackle, paint, install trim, and more. It took MUCH longer than we anticipated, and there&#x27;s still some finishing touches left to do, but the end result looks amazing.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxODAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Dining Room Final" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Dining Room Final" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fdiningroomfinal.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fdiningroomfinal.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>Over the summer, I also had the bright idea to play on 3 different hockey teams. I love playing hockey, but 3 teams was slightly excessive. As much as I love it, playing 3-4 times a week took its toll. This also didn&#x27;t help with the home renovations either. I&#x27;m back down to 2 teams, and it seems like the happy medium. Often times more than once per week, but not really more than twice.</p><p>In September, Lauren and I spent the week in Cape May, NJ. It was a nice, relaxing vacation. Not much to say about it other than it was relaxing and a beautiful week to be there. One nice part was that we discovered <a href="http://capemaybrewery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cape May Brewing Company</a>. We spent an afternoon at their tasting room and ended up coming home with 2 growlers full of delicious beer.</p><p>Just under 2 weeks after getting back, Lauren and I went to Vermont for our anniversary. We had gone up to the Mount Snow area for my brother&#x27;s wedding in July and while it was cloudy and rainy, it was definitely beautiful. We decided that it would be a great destination in the fall with the leaves changing. We ended up staying in a little AirBnB apartment in Wilmington, Vermont; a small little town with a lot of charm. It was absolutely gorgeous. We spent a few days just wandering around taking pictures (that I&#x27;m still going through). We met up with some of our friends from Maine in Concord, New Hampshire one day. We also checked out several craft breweries. We visited:</p><ul><li><a href="http://madisonbrewingco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madison Brewing Company in Bennington, Vermont</a></li><li><a href="http://www.elmcitybrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elm City Brewing in Keene, New Hampshire</a></li><li><a href="http://www.whetstonestation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whetstone Station in Brattleboro, Vermont</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gildedotter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilded Otter in New Paltz, New York</a></li></ul><p>The only downside to where we were, was that many places seemed to close by 8 or 9 pm. But take that away, it was a great trip and I would totally go back again.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxODAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Wilmington Vermont" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Wilmington Vermont" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fvermont.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-in-review%2Fvermont.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>In terms of my fitness goals, it was a mixed bag. I didn&#x27;t really get anywhere on my weight or body fat percentage, but I was able to notable increase my strength. At the end of the year I had hit 200 lbs. on bench press, 305 lbs. on deadlifts, &amp; 245 lbs. on squats. In terms of running, I had started to get back into running after running the marathon in 2015, but it was also the first year in a while I didn&#x27;t run a single race, 5k, half marathon or otherwise. I was supposed to run a 15k and Broad Street, but both days, the weather was crummy and while I wanted to run them, but rain makes me miserable and I guess I just didn&#x27;t want it enough. I&#x27;m hoping to run at least one half-marathon this year.</p><p>It was a good year. Too much to really hit everything in a single blog post, but I&#x27;m looking forward to 2017.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[This post is a follow-up on my previous post <a href="http://kpwags.com/technology/2016/08/23/about-the-iphone-7.html">about the iPhone 7</a>.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is a follow-up on my previous post <a href="http://kpwags.com/technology/2016/08/23/about-the-iphone-7.html">about the iPhone 7</a>.</p><p>Apple last week announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7</a> and the Apple Watch Series 2. As predicted, the iPhone 7 will no longer have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Now that the dust has settled somewhat, I figured I‚Äôd throw in my two cents.</p><p>Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller claimed that the reason Apple did it was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courage</a>. I heard that, and had I been drinking something, it might have come back up through my nose. Apple says that it takes courage to try something new. I personally find that to be a load of BS. Look, I get it, its old technology, but it‚Äôs still the de facto standard. Removing it is going to make it difficult for a lot of people to listen to their music on their phones. Apple is providing headphones that plug into the lightning port which isn‚Äôt bad until you realize that you can‚Äôt charge your phone and listen at the same time (this is also ignoring that I feel the standard headphones are uncomfortable in the ear anyway, but that‚Äôs a different story). They also are nice enough to include a lightning to 3.5mm adapter, which is also sweet...until...wait for it...you can‚Äôt charge and listen to your headphones at the same time. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-iphone-7s-first-headphone-and-charge-dongle-isnt-coming-from-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belkin released a dongle that allows you to plug in 2 lightning cables into your phone</a>, ostensibly one for your headphones and one for the power cable. This is all well and good, until you realize you will then need 2 dongles to listen to 3.5mm headphones and charge your phone at the same time.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjQwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM4NSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img alt="Belkin iPhone adapter" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Belkin iPhone adapter" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7%2Fbelkin-adapter.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7%2Fbelkin-adapter.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7%2Fbelkin-adapter.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>It‚Äôs just an ugly solution. Ignoring the fact that I personally would want multiple adapters and dongles to keep with me at my various locations so I don‚Äôt constantly have to move them around and potentially lose them, it‚Äôs just obnoxious. Add to this the incompatibility with the Apple computers (Macbook, Macbook Pro, iMac, etc) and it‚Äôs kind of a WTF moment.</p><p>People have also made the argument that it allows the phone to be slightly thinner. Thinner isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, but hardly what determines my buying decisions (within reason of course). I might‚Äôve been willing to buy this argument, except for the fact that there is still a bump in the phone for the camera lens. Couldn‚Äôt you just make the phone a little thicker and make the lens flush with the case? This would probably allow enough room to re-add the 3.5mm jack!</p><p>Instead Apple wants to add their own proprietary standard to things making it difficult for people to move in and away from their platform. I love me Apple products, I think they‚Äôre great pieces of technology that are incredibly functional, well designed, and a pleasure to use. I just don‚Äôt know I can even begin to get behind this change, which is a shame because of all the other improvements Apple put into the iPhone 7 and the improvements they‚Äôve made with iOS10 (which I love on my iPhone 6 by the way). Despite how I feel, I haven‚Äôt completely ruled out upgrading to the iPhone 7, but I‚Äôm currently leaning towards either sticking with my iPhone 6 or waiting to see what <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/01/google-will-announce-pixel-phones-4k-chromecast-google-home-daydream-vr-viewer-on-october-4th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google brings with their rumored Pixel and Pixel XL phones in early October</a>.</p><p>There‚Äôs also rumors of Apple inquiring about the 3.5mm headphone jack in the Macbook Pro. This would likely mean the same thing there as well. All I can say to that is NO!</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE5NiIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img alt="Michael Scott - NO" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Michael Scott - NO" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7%2Fmichael-scott-no.gif&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7%2Fmichael-scott-no.gif&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-09-15-thoughts-on-the-iphone-7%2Fmichael-scott-no.gif&amp;w=640&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been a lot of rumors swirling around about the iPhone 7 coming out in September.</p><p>One of the biggest rumors is that it will lack a 3.5mm headphones port. The more I think about this, the more I feel like this is a mistake on Apple‚Äôs part.</p><p>I‚Äôve seen people compare this change to the whole idea of Apple getting rid of the 3.5‚Äù floppy drive in the past, and more recently the optical drives. But here‚Äôs the difference between the standard headphone jack and the floppy and optical drives, the floppy drive and the optical drives were already on their way out. Apple just decided to be the one of the first to move on from them. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I tried to put a DVD in my Macbook Pro only to remember I don‚Äôt have one. Simply put, I just don‚Äôt miss it.</p><p>This is most definitely not the case when it comes to the headphones port. The 3.5mm headphones jack is still dominantly used with headphones. To simply remove it will make it that much more difficult for people to listen to music, podcasts, video, and anything else with an audio track on their phones.</p><p>There will most likely be a lightning adapter to allow people to plug in their old headphones, one might even come with a lightning port as well so you can charge your phone and listen at the same time. This still misses the point though. People will need to carry one more thing around with them in order to listen.</p><p>Bluetooth headphones are of course a second option but they come with their own drawbacks such as keeping them charged and generally lower sound quality as well. I have two pairs of these for use at the gym, but generally use my earbuds and over the head headphones for most of my listening.</p><p>The other thing to keep in mind is if Apple releases a new type of headphones that interfaces with the lightning port is the whole idea of lock-in. Apple is generally known for keeping people locked into their platform and the lightning port is no exception. The lightning port is only used in Apple devices and to bring lightning headphones into existence means that people who want to use these headphones are pretty much forced to use Apple devices or to possibly get an adapter to make it compatible with Android devices or say a Macbook Pro. Essentially the headphones will work on iPhones and iPads‚Ä¶and not much else.</p><p>Now one thing that could make this whole thing interesting is if Apple continues down the USB-C path. The current Macbook has a USB-C port, which is a standard and from my understanding, a good one too. If Apple decides to use USB-C on the iPhone 7, and opts for USB-C headphones (whatever they might look like), that could make things interesting. Since USB-C is used beyond Apple devices (Android has several USB-C phones), lock-in wouldn‚Äôt occur assuming other platforms open up for Audio through the USB port. I‚Äôm not exactly holding my breath for this option, but I suppose it‚Äôs possible.</p><p>Could whatever Apple is coming up with be better than the 3.5mm headphones jack? Given its age, it‚Äôs certainly due for disruption. I just question forcing it over right now when the 3.5mm jack is such widely used on a regular basis is a good idea. I‚Äôm currently in a holding pattern trying to decide what I want to do for my next phone. I‚Äôm not sold on something new, but will go into the upcoming announcement with an open mind. If the headphones port is removed and its replacement isn‚Äôt something that seems workable, I might end up moving back to Android before I end up getting locked into a single platform and ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month was pretty much a complete wash. I didn&#x27;t really progress at all.</p><p>Granted I didn&#x27;t really regress so I guess I&#x27;ll count it as a win. Between 2 weddings, the dining room, plans every weekend, I just couldn&#x27;t get into a routine. At the end of the day though, I should have tried harder to maintain some kind of consistency.</p><p>My weight has been ticking up a little bit and I‚Äôm not quite sure what my actual body fat percentage is. I use a Fitbit Aria scale every morning to weigh myself and all of a sudden it‚Äôs really just jumping around. Some days it‚Äôs in the 25% range, the next it‚Äôs down below 23%. I know the bioelectrical impedance it uses to measure isn‚Äôt the most accurate, but before I felt like it was at least consistent enough to give myself a good idea of where I‚Äôm at. Now, I‚Äôm not sure. I did buy calipers to help, but I need to learn the best way to use them. The instructions they came with weren‚Äôt completely clear.</p><p>Here&#x27;s my progress for the month of July compared with the end of June</p><ul><li><strong>Days Active:</strong> 19</li><li><strong>Trips to the Gym:</strong> 11</li><li><strong>Number of Runs:</strong> 6</li><li><strong>Distance Ran:</strong>: 18.34 miles</li></ul><h3>Body Composition</h3><ul><li><strong>Weight (Change):</strong> 181.2 lbs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April was not a good month for me. I was far less active than I wanted to be and wasn‚Äôt able to make it to the gym as often as I planned and generally have this year so far.</p><p>The only real excuse I have is that I was busy working on the house. A little over a month ago, I ended up gutting my dining room to re-do it so I was spending some of my evenings working on that in lieu of the gym since I‚Äôd be exhausted and unable to work if I went to the gym. I mean it‚Äôs not the end of the world as I do want to have the dining room finished as soon as possible, but I could have been better.</p><p>The destruction of the dining room has also impacted my kitchen as they‚Äôre right next to each other. In an attempt to lessen the constant cleaning of the kitchen, my wife and I have been making crockpot meals since they require less cooking and are generally easier to make. While most of them are healthy, some of them could probably be healthier. Again, combined with the lower activity levels, my diet really needs to be cleaned up some. I‚Äôve been trying to cut, but my cravings all too often get the better of me.</p><p>The nicer weather has allowed me to get out and run a little bit. I was going to run Broad Street, Philly‚Äôs popular 10 mile run May 1st, but it was pouring and a little chilly so I decided to pass on it this year as I didn&#x27;t want to get myself sick. I think I‚Äôm still going to keep my focus on the gym as I‚Äôve been making progress on my lifts, and want to keep doing so. I‚Äôm going to be on 3 hockey teams over the summer and that might limit my ability to make it to the gym as often as I‚Äôd like, but I‚Äôm still going to keep on trying.</p><p>Here‚Äôs hoping that May is a better month for me.</p><p>Here&#x27;s my progress for the month of April compared with the end of March</p><ul><li><strong>Days Active:</strong> 17</li><li><strong>Trips to the Gym:</strong> 8</li><li><strong>Number of Runs:</strong> 8</li><li><strong>Distance Ran:</strong>: 18.68 miles</li></ul><h3>Body Composition</h3><ul><li><strong>Weight (Change):</strong> 181.1 lbs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I feel like I had a good February.</p><p>I managed to regularly make it to the gym and really noticed some gains in my strength. I was able to bring all of my major lifts up, and feel good about my progress there. I made some tweaks early in the month spreading my workouts out a little bit to cut down my time at the gym. I am now doing a 4 day split which is nice because it does keep the time at the gym lifting around 1 hour which I feel is the sweet spot for my life as a whole. I still do add cardio to some of the workouts, normally in the form of a 10 minute High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Treadmill Run. This is essentially why the total distance ran has decreased for February as I&#x27;ve been focusing on higher intensity rather than distance.</p><p>The whole diet factor still is an issue I&#x27;m trying to correct, but I&#x27;m getting a little better.</p><p>I am running Broad Street (10 miles) at the beginning of May and will likely be running a 15k at the beginning of April so I&#x27;ll probably be adding in some runs to my workouts.</p><p>Here&#x27;s my progress for the month of February compared with the end of January</p><ul><li><strong>Days Active:</strong> 23</li><li><strong>Trips to the Gym:</strong> 21</li><li><strong>Number of Runs:</strong> 14</li><li><strong>Distance Ran:</strong>: 29.31 miles</li></ul><h3>Body Composition</h3><ul><li><strong>Weight (Change):</strong> 179.1 lbs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I was in a &quot;I want to develop something mood&quot; recently, but didn&#x27;t feel like digging into a big project, so I came up with an idea for a new project.</p><p>My wife and I, more often than I would care to admit, fail to come to a consensus on where we would like to go to eat should it not be a night we&#x27;re cooking. I decided I would put a stop to this, or at least create a tool that would help put a stop to this. I created a tool that randomly chose where we went to eat. I broke local restaurants into 3 categories: Order Out, Fast Food &amp; Dine In. I then broke them out by type of food such as Mexican, Italian, etc. I put all of the recipes into a JSON file and with a tool to choose the filters and then a click of a button, it would tell us where we&#x27;re going to get food. It worked great!</p><p>Thinking about it a little more, I decided that I&#x27;d try my hand at something a little more universal that other people can use. A JSON file is all nice for what Lauren and I need, but the list of restaurants probably isn&#x27;t all that useful for someone living in New York or California. In the end, I decided to use Google&#x27;s Places API to randomly choose a restaurant for anyone.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTYwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Where Do You Want To Eat" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Where Do You Want To Eat" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-02-19-i-made-a-thing%2Fwhere-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-02-19-i-made-a-thing%2Fwhere-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2016-02-19-i-made-a-thing%2Fwhere-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>All the person would need to do would be to enter their zip code and boom, a restaurant would be chosen. It worked out pretty well. But then I realized that it didn&#x27;t really give much flexibility to the result. I then decided to give the user the option to enter in a custom query to randomly choose from. In the first version of it, I defaulted the query to &quot;restaurant&quot; which works well enough, but it&#x27;s not the most specific. So I added a new textbox for users to enter their custom query to replace the default. So now, it&#x27;s even possible for users to randomly decide which shoe store to go to. Not quite the intention of the tool, but hey, it still works.</p><p>The next improvement I made was to add the ability for users to choose the distance for which to look. Again, this is more to make it a little bit more granular so people can choose how far away they&#x27;re willing to go.</p><p>I even decided to take it one step further and use Google&#x27;s API to help geolocate where the person using the site is. The site now asks the user to share his/her location and then extrapolates the zip code. I figured this is one less step the user has to do and could be useful if the person is out of their normal area and doesn&#x27;t know what zip code they&#x27;re in. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I don&#x27;t know many zip codes other than the ones I use on a regular basis.</p><p>In the end, it was a pretty fun project to work on. Simple, yet satisfying.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;ve decided this year that I really want to rid myself of my gut. I think it&#x27;s shrunk over the last year or two and I have gone down in pants size, but I&#x27;ve always wanted to get rid of it in its entirety. I don&#x27;t know if that will happen this year, but I definitely want to see the majority of it go away. To that end, I&#x27;ve been making a concerted effort to go to the gym more with what I feel is a good lifting plan, and to generally just stay active.</p><p>The biggest issue I&#x27;ve had with it is diet. I unfortunately love food, and I love beer. It&#x27;s not exactly a great combination. My increased activity level has most certainly helped keep myself at my current weight (hovering just below 180 lbs.) but it hasn&#x27;t allowed me to lose more weight, or decrease my body fat percentage an in turn my gut. I&#x27;ve also started to do some meal prep for work lunches. Between chili, pork and carrots, and chicken and broccoli, my lunches have generally stayed healthy. My dinners haven&#x27;t been too bad either. My biggest weakness has been weekends. Part of my issue is that during the week, I&#x27;m generally on a 3 meal schedule, whereas on the weekend, the schedule isn&#x27;t always set so rigidly. Hopefully once I can square some of it away, it will get easier, and I&#x27;ll get better with things.</p><p>Life&#x27;s too short to completely give up beer, good food, and spending time out with friends and family, but it&#x27;s definitely something I can get better with.</p><p>To help keep me honest, I&#x27;m going to be including the following information on my previous month&#x27;s activities and changes. For the record, when I count active days, I&#x27;m counting days where I&#x27;ve done a notable physical activity whether it be a run, a trip to the gym, playing hockey, or going for a walk.</p><p>Here are my stats for January 2016. The changes are compared to January 1.</p><ul><li><strong>Days Active:</strong> 24</li><li><strong>Trips to the Gym:</strong> 19</li><li><strong>Number of Runs:</strong> 15</li><li><strong>Distance Ran:</strong>: 45.07 miles</li></ul><h3>Body Composition</h3><ul><li><strong>Weight (Change):</strong> 180.6 lbs. (-1 lbs.)</li><li><strong>Body Fat % (Change):</strong> 23.2% (+0.8%)</li></ul><h3>Weight Lifting Benchmarks</h3><ul><li><strong>Bench Press (Change):</strong> 155 lbs. (+10 lbs.)</li><li><strong>Squat (Change):</strong> 205 lbs. (+40 lbs.)</li><li><strong>Deadlift (Change):</strong> 195 lbs. (+15 lbs.)</li><li><strong>Overhead Press (Change):</strong> 100 lbs. (+15 lbs.)</li></ul><p><em>Edit: Corrected the number of runs</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#x27;ve read my blog at all, you know that I&#x27;m a big fan of <a href="http://kpwags.com/2014/02/05/podcasts-galore.html">podcasts</a>. They&#x27;re a great way to learn about a whole variety of subjects to fit your tastes. I listen to so many podcasts I unfortunately have to pick and choose which episodes I listen to based on interest levels, which for me is fine. It&#x27;d be nice to be able to listen to everything, but there just isn&#x27;t enough time in the day.</p><p>At work, I&#x27;ve generally switched over to podcasts most days to help pass the time. The only time this becomes an issue is when I&#x27;m working on more complicated problems and really need to focus on what I&#x27;m doing. In this case, it&#x27;s not so much that the podcast is distracting me, but it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m not really paying attention to it as much so if there&#x27;s a story involved, which generally is the case, I hear something and have almost no context for it.</p><p>The one thing I did find is that podcasts are great for running, especially distance running. Music is great to keep you pumped up and going, but what I&#x27;ve found is that when I&#x27;m running longer distances, listening to a story or dialogue distracts me just enough to keep my focus off of any pain or the drudgery of pushing myself to go that final mile. The best way to put it I guess is that I&#x27;m so focused on the podcasts, I don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m running.</p><p>I listen to podcasts primarily on my phone, but also on my iPad and Nexus 7. I use the Pocket Casts app and find that it works great for what I need. It syncs my podcasts, podcast playlists, which podcasts I&#x27;ve listened to, and best of all, where I&#x27;m at in the current podcast I&#x27;m listening to in case I switch devices. It&#x27;s available on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, and it has a web version. Both the Android and iOS apps are great, but I&#x27;ve found the web version to be a bit buggy. It&#x27;s not a free app, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</p><p>In case you&#x27;re interested, here is the current list of podcasts I listen to</p><ul><li><a

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did it. I actually did it. Even almost a month later it sometimes dawns on me how amazing it is that I was able to run a full marathon (26.2 miles).</p><p>In March 2010, I tried to run a 5k and failed miserably not even really able to run a mile. I finished the 5k, mostly by walking and probably annoying those running it, but it wasn&#x27;t one of my proudest moments. That was actually what sparked my decision to get myself in better shape. I started going for walks, and in June to July 2010 after I moved to Plymouth Meeting, I started going for 2-3 mile runs. Granted most of these runs included plenty of walking breaks, I was starting out well and was on my way. Slowly these runs had less and less walking breaks and my average pace started to creep down to the 12 minute mile range. In late July, I joined LA Fitness with my buddy LJ and started working on my strength training as well. I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing with regards to strength training, but I also didn&#x27;t really have much in terms of muscle, so I had to start somewhere. Well I continued to run both at the gym and around my apartment and in March 2011, 1 year later, I ran the same 5k in 34:03.</p><p>Fast forward to 2013, I had just hurt my shoulder playing Baseball, so really, the only thing I could really do was run. Lifting weights was notably limited as my right arm was causing me pain. I went through physical therapy to fix the shoulder, but in the meantime I started running more. After successfully running almost 11 miles one Saturday, I decided to sign up for the Philadelphia Half Marathon in November 2013 and successfully ran that in 2:15:38.</p><p>Not to be outdone, in 2014 I signed up for the Philadelphia Full Marathon in November 2014. In the meantime, I ended up running Broad Street (10 miles), and 2 half marathons during the spring and summer. Unfortunately, my left knee started giving me problems and I was unable to run the marathon in November. I went through physical therapy, got exercises to help prepare me for another try and in April 2015, I signed up to run the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon.</p><p>My training started at the end of July, right after vacation, and right as my wife and I decided to buy a house. The next month was hectic with me running 4 days a week and working on the house. Training was going well until the end of September, beginning of October. I had hit a new record high of 16 miles, but started to feel pain in my right foot. I tried again a week later, and sure enough the pain was still there. I thought it was a stress fracture, but it turned out to just be inflammation thankfully (sorta). It unfortunately kept me from running for 2 weeks right in the middle of the longest runs of my training. I went to the gym and spent time on the elliptical and stationary bike in an attempt to try to keep myself active and my cardiovascular system active. Late October, early November I started running again and was able to hit 10+ miles without pain in my foot so I was hopeful I might be able to pull the marathon off after all. I probably should have trained a little more, but on November 22nd, I gave the Philadelphia Marathon my best effort and was able to complete it in 5:12:16.</p><p>The pain was excruciating. Around mile 2, my right knee started hurting. At mile 17, my foot started hurting. At mile 23, I developed a blister on one of my toes. But I can proudly say I was able to persevere and finish. I like to think it was my determination to not have to train to run another marathon that helped me finish, but running 24 miles with some pretty sharp pain in my right knee was not fun. My cousin Tim met up with me in Manyunk and thankfully I had him to run the last 6-7 miles with. It made the pain a lot easier to bear. I did have to take a few more walking breaks than I would have liked, but at the end of the days, who cares, I did it! My parents, sister &amp; her boyfriend, as well as my best friend all showed up and I was in tears as I crossed the finish line.</p><p>I wanted to say I ran a marathon in my lifetime, and now I can say I did so.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI5NzAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyIgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4xIi8+"/></div><img alt="Me finishing the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Me finishing the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2015-12-17-i-finally-ran-a-marathon%2Fmarathon-complete.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2015-12-17-i-finally-ran-a-marathon%2Fmarathon-complete.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2015-12-17-i-finally-ran-a-marathon%2Fmarathon-complete.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Ran 26.2 miles after a long journey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last several months, I‚Äôve been busy building out my website utilizing <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> instead of Wordpress. It‚Äôs not my first time moving away from Wordpress, but I think it will end up being permanent.</p><p>I do want to write more and I do hope to do so soon, but the fact of the matter is that in all honesty, I really don&#x27;t blog as much as I want. This lack of posts has the distinct advantage of trying in with what was the biggest difference to me between Jekyll and WordPress. Jekyll does not use or require a database.</p><p>Instead, it uses files to identify the individual pages and posts. Want to add a new post? Just add a file to the posts folder with a given filename format. Jekyll is part of a new <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trend with static website generators</a> and I have to say that for my current needs, this works out perfectly.</p><p>Because Jekyll just uses files to handle the posts, it makes backing up much simpler. Hell, I can just keep everything in a Git repository and I&#x27;m good to go...which is exactly what I do.</p><p>As for the design, I decided I wanted something a little more simple. I do love the cover images, but decided that want really what I wanted for the new look. I decided I liked the idea of a short summary about myself in a sidebar with the main content in the main section. It&#x27;s simple, and in my humble opinion, elegant. I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of images completely and I wanted to keep something there to continue the &quot;feel&quot; of a cover image without actually having a cover image. To do this, I decided to add an image header to pages and posts that was easily able to be customized, but yet still compelling. I actually like it because I can change it between a 1, 2 or 3 image header very easily.</p><p>I still have a few things I want to do to improve it. It is responsive, and looks good on both desktop and mobile. The images however, could be better optimized, so I‚Äôll probably do what I can to improve that for mobile once the holiday season is over and things calm down some. I want to make a few CSS tweaks here and there as well, but nothing major. The only thing I‚Äôm still debating on is whether I want to bother with comments. I‚Äôm leaning against it at the moment figuring people can get a hold of me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/kpwags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> or other social media channels if they want, but of course I could change my mind down the road.</p><p>As part of this change I also ended up moving my hosting from Rackspace to Amazon Web Services. I&#x27;ve been meaning to look into AWS and finally decided to give it a try. Having your own server is convenient, but there&#x27;s something to be said to not have to worry about it when you&#x27;re only running a simple blog. I still have other sites on Rackspace, but we&#x27;ll see how long they remain there.</p><p>Let me know what you think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to the <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reply All</a> podcast today and they had an interesting <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/43-the-law-that-sticks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode regarding the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>. I knew some basics about it, but never knew how general and open-ended it really was. It really is disturbing to me that people could be charged for simply violating the terms of service on a site like Facebook. It‚Äôs highly unlikely that the government will go after you for it, but it&#x27;s still scary to know that the potential is there.</p><p>I mention this because it‚Äôs disturbing to me that this law doesn‚Äôt get the attention it seems to deserve. We‚Äôre not talking about evil ‚Äúhackers‚Äù here going in and stealing credit card and social security numbers. This law can be used to go after people for petty mischief, acts that one would generally just shrug off are now being charged as felonies.</p><p>After Aaron Swartz died, there was a push to narrow the law to have it make more sense to what its intent really was. The amendment, nicknamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act&amp;redirect=no#Aaron_Swartz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron‚Äôs Law</a> would have decriminalized terms of service violations and help prevent people from being charged criminally for something that shouldn‚Äôt belong in the courts. Unfortunately, this bill stalled in Congress in 2014.</p><p>I would love for this to be revisited by Congress, but given the current atmosphere in D.C., I kind of doubt it will happen. One can hope though.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#x27;s been a while since the last time I&#x27;ve posted anything on here so I figured I&#x27;d give a little bit of an update as to what I&#x27;ve been up to.</p><p>Starting in January, I decided I really wanted to focus on getting back into better shape. This meant that I needed to start going back to the gym. Well, my normal gym routine generally has been 30 minutes of cardio followed by about 1 hour on the weights. It&#x27;s actually a workout that I&#x27;ve been enjoying. The only downside, is that I don&#x27;t get back home until around 8pm. By the time I get home, shower and eat, it&#x27;s close to 9pm and I&#x27;m tired and don&#x27;t really want to do much other than rest, relax and spend time with my wife.</p><p>The other thing that&#x27;s been taking up my time is hockey. I&#x27;m in 2 leagues which has been keeping me quite busy. My C-League team didn&#x27;t have that many games to start the season, which meant that in the latter half of the season, there are plenty of games. That, in addition to my I-League season, I&#x27;m playing 2-3 times a week. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I absolutely love it, but it&#x27;s been keeping me occupied. At one point I&#x27;ve had hockey 3 nights in a row. Come to think of it, it&#x27;s going to happen again this Sunday, Monday &amp; Tuesday. Oh boy‚Ä¶</p><p>I also signed up for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon so I&#x27;m going to be starting to train for that pretty soon. I&#x27;m excited because the physical therapy and exercises they gave me to do have seemed to help. A couple weeks ago I was able to run 9 miles without knee pain which is a good sign as my 2014 marathon was derailed by knee pain at the 7 mile mark. I found a training program that should be doable and it&#x27;s already entered into my calendar.</p><p>I also have 2 new projects I&#x27;ve been working on that I&#x27;ll go into details about soon, but for now, I&#x27;ll just say that I&#x27;m excited about it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[This has been in the works for some time now.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been in the works for some time now.</p><p>I decided I wanted a better <a href="http://kpwags.com/photography">photography site</a> first, and then along the way I decided that maybe I should short of unite the two. My blog had its own simplistic look, and my photography site was just out there with no real tie to my blog other than my name being in the header.</p><p>The first thing that really made me want to move past my old photography site was The Daily Shot. It was a good idea, at least I think it was, but I found that I never really found all that much to take photos of. That, and I felt like the photos I were taking were becoming more and more repetitive.</p><p>The second thing was that the site just felt clunky to me. I developed it to try and keep it as a one page site more or less, but never really felt that it worked all that well, especially factoring in the responsiveness of the website.</p><p>So I decided to scrap The Daily Shot and start from scratch with building a new site. I wanted something that was visual and really stood out. I figured all I really needed was two pages. An index to give a little blurb about me and my journey into photography, and a dynamic album page to display each album.</p><p>The index page wasn&#x27;t all that hard to figure out, but I decided that breaking the albums down by year might be helpful especially with tracking the journey and my improvement (hopefully) with my picture taking skills.</p><p>The next part was building the individual album page. I wanted something that would stand out and really grab the attention of the visitor. I decided to go with a cover image since they&#x27;re both visual and a great way to describe the album.</p><p>Once I got the cover idea nailed down, it was onto laying out the grid of photos which was super simple in comparison to figuring out the best way to do the cover responsively. The only decision I had was what do I want to have happen when a user clicks on a photo. I was thinking about adding a page for the photo but figured that would be overkill since it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m adding the ability to comment on them, so I just went with a lightbox to make out simple.</p><p>I really do like the way it turned out. I feel like the visuals really stand out and sort of draw the eyes in.</p><p>This led to the blog itself, I liked how the photography portion turned out so much, I decided that while I was at it, I would give my blog a facelift.</p><p>The first thing I decided to do was get rid of the categories. I originally liked that idea, but over time and really not writing all that much, I decided that they really didn&#x27;t work for what I was focusing on. I also decided that I really liked the cover look of my photography redesign so I wanted to keep up the theme. Having a full screen image for the homepage made perfect sense. Having a full screen image for the about and contact pages didn&#x27;t make as much sense so I decided to just have the images take up roughly one third of the screen. The biggest challenge I had was for posts. I wanted to do full screen, but figured I wouldn&#x27;t always have a good image for each post or that maybe some posts wouldn&#x27;t really be long enough or even warrant one.</p><p>My solution I think was a good one. I essentially have two ‚Äúcategories‚Äù right now. I put categories in quotes because they aren&#x27;t categories that you would think. They&#x27;re really just a type of post. One is called a Post, the other a Blurb. Posts are the longer, posts (like this one) while Blurbs are there for entries that tend to be shorter and maybe not as lengthy. Posts will have full screen covers, while blurbs will just have the smaller header image. I felt like this was a nice compromise that gave me the best of both worlds.</p><p>I did my best to test this across devices, so if you see something wonky or something that doesn&#x27;t look right, please let me know. Just let me know what browser/device you&#x27;re using so I can try to narrow down where the issue is.</p><p>You can check out my photography site <a href="https://kpwags.com/photography">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, I&#x27;m really starting to do some longer races. I&#x27;ve already run Broad Street (10 miles), and have 2 more half-marathons and then a full marathon in November. Since I&#x27;ve started running back in 2010, I&#x27;ve been using <a href="http://www.runkeeper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runkeeper</a> on my phone to track my runs to give myself an idea how far and how fast I&#x27;m running. It&#x27;s a pretty nice little app and service using your phone&#x27;s GPS to track how you&#x27;re doing and overlaying your path over Google Maps. But as I&#x27;ve been running more and participating in some longer races, I&#x27;ve noticed that its accuracy was starting to become questionable.</p><p>When I ran the Philadelphia Half-Marathon in 2013, I used Runkeeper and found that it had me running around 14.5 miles. Given that a half-marathon is 13.1, I couldn&#x27;t imagine the officials at the Philly Marathon measured the course so far off from the official distance. Looking at the map, I found that the GPS had me sort of all over the course of the run. Rather than being in a relatively straight line across the course, it had me zigging and zagging across the course. Over the course of a 13.1 mile race, that zigging and zagging added up. I ended up having to go in and edit the map and the GPS points to make it closer to what I actually ran. I was disappointed in it, but it gave me a mostly-decent idea how I&#x27;ve been doing, and since it&#x27;s a free app and service (with a paid premium option), I can&#x27;t really complain. Plus I didn&#x27;t know how much of it was the app and how much was the phone&#x27;s GPS antenna.</p><p>Fast forward to the Broad Street Run and I used my phone and Runkeeper again to track my run. After finishing the race, I happened to look at the map on Runkeeper and it was pretty far off from the actual run. At one point it had me 2-3 blocks away from where I actually was. For anyone who is not familiar with Philadelphia, Broad Street is a major north-south road in Philadelphia. It is around 13 miles and it is pretty much completely straight. The fact that Runkeeper put me 2-3 blocks away, even in areas outside of Center City where there are no skyscrapers to interfere with GPS satellite reception was disappointing. Again though, I can&#x27;t say that the problem is Runkeeper or the GPS antenna in my phone.</p><p>After Broad Street and with several big races coming up, I decided I wanted to find something that was a little better at tracking my runs. My friend Brian recommended a Garmin GPS watch and I ended up getting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-GPS-Enabled-Sport-Monitor/dp/B003J2V8AC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garmin Forerunner 110</a> with a Heart Rate monitor. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 runs so far and am actually pretty happy with the results. None of the runs have been incredibly far, but looking at the maps, it seems that the watch is pretty accurate GPS-wise. The only thing I miss is the automatic uploading to the cloud. Runkeeper automatically uploads your activities to the cloud for you to review and see how you did, the model I have requires me to plug the watch into my computer to upload the activities to <a href="http://www.garminconnect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garmin Connect</a> to review. All in all it&#x27;s minor and doesn&#x27;t bother me as it really only takes 5 minutes to complete, but it&#x27;s still something I miss.</p><p>Garmin Connect actually does a pretty good job at displaying the information to you as well. It gives you a map showing your run as well as graphs showing the elevation, pace, and if you wore your heart rate monitor, your heart rate as well. You can click below for an example of what a run looks like through the Garmin interface.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTI5NCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxOTIwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Garmin Connect Run View" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Garmin Connect Run View" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-05-27-tracking-my-runs%2Fgarmin-connect.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-05-27-tracking-my-runs%2Fgarmin-connect.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-05-27-tracking-my-runs%2Fgarmin-connect.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>You can see that it gives you a pretty good idea of how I did based on elevation, how I was able to maintain or lose my pace as well as where my heart rate was.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of January I decided to make the switch to the Ghost blogging platform. I had heard good things about it and decided to move over to it. Well, this past week I decided I wanted to expand a bit more with how I blog and realized that Ghost really wasn&#x27;t going to work for what I needed. Given that and my limited knowledge of node.js, I decided that I&#x27;d be better served moving back to WordPress as my platform since I am familiar with PHP and its inner workings.</p><p>It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision and I&#x27;d be lying if I said that I wasn&#x27;t second guessing myself, but for the moment, I&#x27;m happy with where I&#x27;m at. I backed up my Ghost install, database and all so if down the line I feel like Ghost would be better suited for what I&#x27;m looking for, I should be able to move back with limited problems.</p><p>At the end of the day, this blog still gives me the space I need to express myself and that is what&#x27;s most important.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it&#x27;s official, this November I will be running my first full marathon. On November 23, 2014 I will be running the Philadelphia Marathon.</p><p>Last year I ran the Philadelphia Half-Marathon which was a huge accomplishment for me and I&#x27;m looking forward to pushing myself to the next level. 4 years ago I could barely run a mile and last year I was able to hit 13.1 miles. Now I get to see if I can run 26.2 miles.</p><p>The marathon will actually be the end of a big running year for me. I&#x27;m going to be running the Broad Street Run in Philly (10 miles) and two half-marathons. I&#x27;m looking forward to running all of these races and am really hoping to get in better shape.</p><p>Now to start training.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered shadowed"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjQwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY0MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img alt="Me running the Phillies 5k" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Me running the Phillies 5k" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-04-01-run-forest-run%2Frun-forest-run.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-04-01-run-forest-run%2Frun-forest-run.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-04-01-run-forest-run%2Frun-forest-run.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week or so ago I decided that I needed a new programming project to work on. I haven&#x27;t really had something like this since I closed the book on OpenVoter.</p><p>Originally I was planning on building a project tracking tool in .NET but I decided that I wanted to do something a little less ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù, at least right now. Instead, I&#x27;ve come up with going back to an older project idea that I abandoned but am now thinking I&#x27;ll go back to.</p><p>I&#x27;m not going to go too much into it right now, but I will say it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m actually excited to build and feel like it&#x27;s a product that I would use on an everyday basis.</p><p>I&#x27;ve already designed the logo and have been working on the wireframes. I&#x27;m hoping to get into actual layout over the next week or so.</p><p>I&#x27;m planning on building it in Ruby on Rails and have mobile apps planned for development as well.</p><p>I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a project for a while and am looking forward to seeing this move forward and becoming a reality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I decided to make the switch from WordPress to Ghost as my blogging platform. For me it was a figuratively big jump as I have been using WordPress for years and hadn&#x27;t really thought of switching to any other platform.</p><p>For me, it was also a challenge to figure out enough about Node.js to be able to set up and configure my blog with Ghost. I ended up getting it up and running on my development server, played around with it, worked on porting my theme over, and finally decided I liked it enough to switch over.</p><p>I&#x27;m still playing around with it, though not as much now that it&#x27;s stable. The only thing I&#x27;m trying to get working is the 404 page. Whenever I try to add my custom error page, the site constantly gives me a 503 error. One day, I&#x27;ll figure this out!</p><p>I really like the writing tool. I&#x27;m still getting used to the markdown syntax, but I love the simplicity of it. It&#x27;s also nice because you can mix in HTML code with it as well to get the additional features you miss with markdown. You can just start writing and not think twice about it.</p><p>I also like the overall simplicity of the platform itself. Not to knock WordPress, but there is a lot of functionality there that is not really needed for a blog. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it is a bad thing as some sites could definitely benefit from the added features, but for my needs, Ghost provides all the functionality I need.</p><p>One feature that I&#x27;m waiting for Ghost to implement is scheduled posting. I would like to be able to schedule a post for the future which I was able to do with WordPress, but not with Ghost. That said, this does seem to be in the feature list for Ghost so I&#x27;m hopeful I&#x27;ll see it in the next release.</p><p>I would also like to see archives functionality. I do miss the ability to view a specific month or year&#x27;s posts which doesn&#x27;t seem to be available currently, but it might be available in a later release.</p><p>Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with my decision to switch over to Ghost. It seems to be a solid platform that works great for me. If you&#x27;re considering it, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a shot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many times while I am working, I often listen to podcasts. I find that they&#x27;re a great way to keep myself up to date with what&#x27;s going on around the world, or just to learn something new.</p><p>I used to listen to NPR a lot more, and I still do, but with all the meetings I&#x27;m called into, I seldomly get to listen to a full story or full episode. Now this is part of working so I&#x27;m not compaining, it just means that podcasts make a little more sense to me since I can pause the episode and come back to it at the point where I left off.</p><p>The app I use to listen to podcasts is called PocketCasts. It has both an Android and an iOS app. I like it because it syncs across my devices. I switch back and forth between my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy S4, so it&#x27;s nice to have the episodes sync across the two. It&#x27;s also nice because it will automatically download the episodes I generally listen to.</p><p>The only downside is that sometimes the counts go up to the point where it is difficult to keep up with them, even when I filter them down to the episodes I am interested in. That being said, I find that it does keep me up to date with what is going on in various different areas such as politics, tech, news, hockey, and more.</p><p>Here&#x27;s a list of the podcasts I listen to:</p><ul><li><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">99% Invisible</a></li><li><a href="http://www.androidpolice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Police Podcast</a></li><li><a href="http://www.arstechnica.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica Podcast</a></li><li><a href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510299/ask-me-another" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask Me Another</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Brian Lehrer Show</a></li><li><a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Carlin&#x27;s Hardcore History</a></li><li><a href="http://freakonomics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freakonomics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresh Air</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marketplace.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=4819382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR: Technology</a></li><li><a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On The Media</a></li><li><a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Point with Tom Ashbrook</a></li><li><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Money</a></li><li><a href="http://krpoliticaljunkie.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political Junkie with Ken Rudin</a></li><li><a href="http://www.puckpodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Puck Podcast</a></li><li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radiolab</a></li><li><a href="http://sciencefriday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Friday</a></li><li><a href="http://www.startalkradio.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Talk with Neil DeGrasse Tyson</a></li><li><a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stuff You Should Know</a></li><li><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TED Radio Hour</a></li><li><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This American Life</a></li><li><a href="http://twit.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TWit: This Week in Tech</a></li><li><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wait, Wait‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt Tell Me</a></li><li><a href="http://whyy.org/cms/radiotimes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHYY Radio Times</a></li></ul><p>Do you listen to podcasts?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight, Bill Nye (the Science Guy) is going to debate the founder of the Creation Museum, Ken Ham. The debate is going to center around the whole Evolution versus Creationism argument.</p><p>But why even really have this debate? I really doubt anyone is really going to have their minds changed by this debate. There are those who believe in evolution, and there are those who believe in creation according to the bible. I feel like those who side with Nye are going to just laugh at Ham&#x27;s arguments, and those who side with Ham, are going to pretty much ignore Nye.</p><p>As someone who believes in science and follows the evidence, I obviously believe Bill Nye to be on the correct side of the argument and it is HIGHLY unlikely my mind will be changed by Ken Ham. With that said, I feel like Bill Nye&#x27;s time and energy would be better spent pushing to improve science education in our schools (keeping creationism out of public school science classes), and just increasing science in the public eye. Maybe if we educate more people about science, scientific theory, and the scientific method, debates like this one won&#x27;t have to happen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several months ago, when Ghost was first released to the public, I took a look at it and made a note to give it a look-see. Over the past week, I finally got it running on my dev server playing nicely with my Apache setup. So far I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and am contemplating whether I want to switch my blog platform over to it from WordPress, which is what I currently use.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been blogging off and on since 2007. My first blog was actually a custom blog that I first built to help myself learn PHP. Since then, I&#x27;ve generally used WordPress with various different looks. WordPress has worked well for me. I&#x27;ve gotten a decent understanding of how it works so I can build themes for it and maintain it properly. I can post from my phone and my tablet with ease through the WordPress app. Simply put, WordPress just works.</p><p>So why should I even contemplate a switch? Truth be told, I still can&#x27;t come up with a great answer for this. I see other people raving about it and its simplicity for simply writing does have a certain draw to it. One of the reasons for this blog was to get me into the habit of writing and Ghost seems to do a great job at doing just that. It doesn&#x27;t yet seem to have the same support that WordPress has for plugins and whatnot, though that&#x27;s apparently in the works. Still though, I don&#x27;t really use any plugins for my blog at all except for Disqus so it probably isn&#x27;t all that big of a deal.</p><p>I guess one of the biggest drawbacks (for me) I see for it is that it&#x27;s written in node.js. I have no problem with node.js, its just that I haven&#x27;t really played around with it much and would like a better understanding of it before I&#x27;m willing to run my site on it. That in itself wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I&#x27;m busy enough the way it is. Now I feel like I&#x27;m just complaining about nothing or maybe I just have too much on my plate at the moment.</p><p>Either way, it&#x27;s something I am still considering, but I can&#x27;t help but to think‚Ä¶if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It wasn&#x27;t the best weather for the trip, but overall I feel we lucked out as we only needed umbrellas twice.

We got tickets to the Harvard-Yale game at MSG and it was a fun time.

The second was that it was around the time when it was &quot;not cool&quot; to really read and study the exhibits, so trying to fit in with my peers, I opted not to care. Fast forward 10 or so years later and I&#x27;ve been wanting to go back to the museum and actually explore the museum for real this time. Needless to say, I&#x27;m glad I did. We didn&#x27;t see the entire museum, but we saw a Dark Matter planetarium show, explored the ocean, and the dinosaurs.</p><div class="PostImage__ImageContainer-sc-1y69a4k-0 cAvydH centered"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTkyMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDgwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg=="/></div><img alt="Skeleton of a Tyrannosarus Rex at the Museum of Natural History" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Skeleton of a Tyrannosarus Rex at the Museum of Natural History" srcSet="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-01-14-exploring-new-york-city%2Ftrex.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-01-14-exploring-new-york-city%2Ftrex.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fposts%2F2014-01-14-exploring-new-york-city%2Ftrex.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div><p>I already miss NYC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So as part of my goals for 2014, I want to buy a house.</p><p>Buying a house means you need to save up money for a down payment. Saving money means limiting your expenses. Limiting your expenses means budgeting and that is where we begin. I&#x27;ve been using a spreadsheet for the past 2 years to help with this and it&#x27;s done a decent job. I played around with Mint a while back, but could never get the hang of it enough to really utilize it. This year, I figure I&#x27;d try again.</p><p>For some reason Mint can no longer connect and sync with my bank account (which I am now locked out of, so I need to call them‚Ä¶sigh) and it&#x27;s handling of budgets &amp; categories still seems clunky. I decided to budget money for &quot;fun&quot;, which could include trips to the movies, dinners, etc. Mint wants to put them all over the place in different categories and it doesn&#x27;t really seem easy to group them all together for my budgeting goals since some months might be more movie heavy while the next might be more &#x27;out-to-dinner&#x27; heavy. As far as I see them, they&#x27;re both in the same group but I&#x27;m having to go into each transaction to adjust them.</p><p>The other complaint I have is goals. I&#x27;m sure the goals they have defaulted work fine. I, however just want a simple, &quot;I want to save $X a month&quot; and it is so difficult to configure. I can go into the custom goals, but even this is not set up nicely. It wants me to set up a saved goal so I set that to $X x 12, but then it takes into account how much money is already in the savings account‚Ä¶it&#x27;s a complete mess for what I want. What I want is a monthly recurring goal, that takes into account the money moved from checking into savings, being completely ignorant to what is already in savings. Just track the money moved. In the end, I just added my savings goal as a budget line-item and got rid of the goals altogether.</p><p>I really don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be sticking with Mint as it really seems to be completely off for what I want. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great for some people, but for me I feel like it&#x27;s so much extra work to get it to be the tool I&#x27;m looking for.</p><p>Do you use Mint or is there another tool you&#x27;d recommend as an alternative?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still can&#x27;t believe that 2013 is almost over. It really seems like the year just flew by. I guess part of it was all the wedding preparation and the wedding itself. There are still some days where I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m married, though I&#x27;m definitely happy I am...just seems so surreal.</p><p>With that said, 2014 is fast approaching and I have several goals I would like to accomplish in the next year. I&#x27;m hoping that I can successfully accomplish most, if not all of them. I&#x27;m going to try to set them to be realistic because too many times I&#x27;ve seen people fail to accomplish their goals due to setting the bar too high. You don&#x27;t want to underachieve, but there&#x27;s still such a thing as going overboard.</p><ol><li>The first goal I have is to complete my first novel which I&#x27;ve titled Glitch&#x27;d, and to write more in general. I&#x27;m around 20,000 words so far, though I&#x27;ve slacked off a bit recently. I&#x27;m using this blog though to help keep me writing figuring it will help keep my creative juices flowing.</li><li>The second goal I have is to train for, and complete a full marathon. There&#x27;s 2 I&#x27;m looking at entering. The first is the Lehigh Valley Marathon September 7. This is supposed to be a nice course that isn&#x27;t too difficult, but I&#x27;m worried about training during July and August. I was able to do some runs this past summer in the high heat and humidity, but I kept them shorter between 3 and 5 miles‚Ä¶a pretty big difference to the 26.2 a full marathon is. The other one, which I will most likely enter regardless, is the Philadelphia Marathon. This is in November, so I&#x27;d have a cooler September and October to train. I might end up doing the half at Lehigh Valley and the full in Philly too, so we&#x27;ll see.</li><li>The third goal I have for myself I figure will fit in with number 2. I would finally like to lose my gut. I don&#x27;t need a six pack or sculpted abs, I just want to be slimmer in my belly. Considering I&#x27;ve lost the weight I already have, I think this is definitely attainable. That being said, I don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m looking forward to the influx of people at the gym after January 1st.</li><li>I would also like to take a chunk out of my video games list. I&#x27;ve gotten so many games through Steam sales, and I would like to beat more of them. I&#x27;ve actually limited my game purchases to help with this goal.</li><li>My fifth goal is to find a new project for me to work on and get off the ground. I&#x27;ve been bouncing around a lot recently with different ideas, and I&#x27;d like to find a single good idea to focus on and bring to fruition. I think I have one, but it needs some more thought with it.</li></ol><p>I think that all of these goals are definitely attainable and time will tell how much I can accomplish. I feel like I&#x27;ve been able to increase my productivity over the last week or two, so I&#x27;m hopeful.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I also was floored by what Lauren got me.

Maybe it&#39;s because I was so occupied with planning my wedding this year, but it really seems like the whole year has just flown by. I guess it doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;ve just been so busy this December. With everything going on, this is the first year that Lauren and I ended up getting a fake tree. I&#39;ve always been far more preferential to real trees because I love their look, and their smell. The fun is also going out and finding the tree and cutting it down. The weather never really cooperated for us going to cut one down, and we realized that we just didn&#39;t have the room. On the plus side, there&#39;s less of a worry that our cat Cookie will eat the Christmas tree and get sick.]]></description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, almost 2 weeks ago, I got married to the most wonderful woman I know. It was amazing, but this is another story.</p><p>We went to Aruba for our honeymoon which obviously requires flying. Well on the flight from Atlanta to Aruba, we ended up flying off the east coast of Florida. I had the window seat and was sort of blankly staring out the window staring down at the ground when all of a sudden I happen to notice a long runway. The first thing that came to mind, being the geek I am, is me wondering if that runway is the Space Shuttle landing strip. So, I take a quick look around and what do you know, there are Launch Pads 39A and 39B where the Space Shuttle and Saturn V rockets took off from. Looking further I was even able to see the Vehicle Assembly Building and the other launch pads situated south of 39A &amp; B. I even had a chance to see what I believe was the new crawler and tower for the launch system that NASA is currently working on.</p><p>The whole time staring down at the ground I&#x27;m completely geeking out. Here is something that I love right beneath me by about 40,000 feet. I&#x27;ve always been interested in NASA and space travel and exploration so to be able to see it from above with my own eyes was amazing. I&#x27;ll have to go back there again one day.</p><p>Lauren definitely understood my reaction, and was happy I was able to see something I love, but those around me probably thought I was nuts. Oh well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I chose the Canon EOS 60D because I liked what it offered, and my girlfriend (now my fiancee) also had it and recommended it to me. I should add that it also is nice since we&#x27;ll be able to share lenses. Fast forward to now, I&#x27;ve gotten better with photography, but don&#x27;t always have the time to go out with my Canon and find those awesome shots.</p><p>About a week ago, I was thinking about this and have come up with an idea for helping fix this. I&#x27;m going to design and build a new website off of this blog where I will post a photo every day. These photos might not necessarily be taken with my Canon, but I figure by training myself to take a photo everyday, I&#x27;ll find some fun angles or even subjects that I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to see otherwise.</p><p>With my wedding coming up soon, I&#x27;m not sure when this will come into fruition, but I&#x27;ve already gotten some wires laid out as to how I want the site to look like. It will really just be a matter of designing it and figuring out the technology behind it. Should be fun!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[About 1-2 years ago, I decided to stop development work on OpenVoter. It&#39;s still there, you can still download and use it, but it just hasn&#39;t been updated. Kind of sad too, because some updates were actually pretty far along for the next version. That said, if I ever end up going back to work on it, it might very well take a fair amount of time to figure out where exactly I left off. But going back to the time that I decided to move on from OpenVoter, I remember debating what I wanted to do somewhat heavily. I really liked what I was able to accomplish with it, but at the same time, it wasn&#39;t really used by anyone that I knew of and didn&#39;t really see it moving anywhere else. In the end, I begrudgingly decided to shelve it and find something else to work on.]]></description>

In the end, I begrudgingly decided to shelve it and find something else to work on.</p><p>I&#x27;ve come up with a few ideas since then, the latest of which I&#x27;ve been on the fence about. I&#x27;ve been contemplating building an RSS reader to replace Google Reader, but I&#x27;m worried that the market has already been rather saturated and is too crowded for a little guy to get in. I have some cool ideas for it, some of them might even give it the differentiation it would need to work if I&#x27;m able to pull it off. It would definitely be a huge undertaking for me and probably more ambitious than OpenVoter. At the end of the day though, I&#x27;m not sure I want to pour my heart and soul into a project that may indeed have no real chance of succeeding. If I can get it to work, I&#x27;d definitely use it though so maybe it still would be worth pursuing. 2 years later, I&#x27;m now faced with the same decision I had with OpenVoter, only now with a different project. Do I continue on, or do I move onto something else? Even though I&#x27;m not all that far along, it&#x27;s still hard to just abandon something.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been contemplating with getting into game development. I have an idea for a pretty cool game that I think I could probably pull off so maybe I&#x27;ll just move onto that. The future is unknown, and I love these challenges‚Ä¶just need to make the time for them and stay focused!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[There never seems to be enough hours in the day to get everything I want to done. Part of that is me failing to motivate myself to focus, the other is just me being busy. Take today for example. I meant to spend a good portion of the afternoon working on teaching myself libGDX for the game idea I have. What did I do? Get myself distracted so much I only got through a very little bit of the one tutorial I was going through. That being said, I can proudly say that it wasn&#39;t Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, or the Internet that distracted me. It was really just my lack of being able to focus that led to me getting up to go sit out on the couch with Lauren, or just roam around aimlessly. Today was not going to be my day to focus.]]></description>

It was really just my lack of being able to focus that led to me getting up to go sit out on the couch with Lauren, or just roam around aimlessly. Today was not going to be my day to focus.</p><p>Things should hopefully end up calming down a bit once the wedding is over...did I mention I&#x27;m getting married in 2 months? Right now I&#x27;m busy with working out at the gym, running, hockey, wedding stuff, and of course work. There really just doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough time in the day to focus on everything.</p><ul><li>Writing my first novel</li><li>Hockey</li><li>Gym &amp; Running (trying to lose my gut)</li><li>Borderlands 2</li><li>RSS Reader</li><li>Game idea</li><li>Game challenge (go through and complete all the games in my rather large library)</li></ul><p>This list is what I currently have on my plate. And that doesn&#x27;t even include wedding planning stuff, spending time with friends, and of course spending time with Lauren. None of it I want to really give up, so it&#x27;s really a challenge to balance it all.</p><p>Motivation &amp; focus are also key here and it always seems to be lacking when I have the time to work on my development projects especially.</p><p>I&#x27;m really hoping I can soon make progress here. I&#x27;m still not quite sure what I want to do about my idea for a new RSS reader, but I have an idea for what could be a pretty cool game. I just would need to teach myself how to build the game, and how to build a functioning AI. It will be a challenge, but challenges can be fun.</p><p>Any recommendations on how to improve one&#x27;s focus?</p>]]></content:encoded>
