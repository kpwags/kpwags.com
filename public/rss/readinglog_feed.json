Lots of big features which previously required an external tool to use, are now native parts of the language, and its growing more and more all the time. If you haven&#x27;t used CSS in a long time, for whatever reason, now is the time to take a look again.</p>\n</blockquote><p>It’s really amazing how far CSS has come recently with all the new features that make both big and little things easier.</p><hr/></div>\n<div class=\"InDepthNote_inDepthNotes__6s_Z7\"><h3><span class=\"source\">Jim Nielsen:</span> <a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/websites-are-for-normies/\">Making a Website is for Everyone</a></h3><p>I agree with both <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@nachtfunke/110912228740815266\">Thomas</a> and Jim on this.</p><blockquote>\n<p>The web’s low barrier to entry led me to a career that has been a boon for my life.

I have seen some cases where a person just can&#x27;t do their job properly.

The higher taxes would pay the government back eventually, so it wouldn&#x27;t cost taxpayers anything.

I just think any major leaguer would be able to just terrify me with a first pitch fastball and then get me to chase garbage out of the zone and that would happen for literally an entire season.”</p>\n</blockquote><p>I played baseball growing up. I don’t think I’d have much success getting a hit. I think I’d be able to eventually make contact, but not much of any substance.

I also feel like my productivity has only increased.</p><p>There are some people who like working in the office, there’s nothing wrong with that. Not everyone feels that way and many are just as productive working from home, some probably more so from the lack of constant interruptions from the “collaboration”.</p><p>What this feels like is companies trying to justify their middle managers and office leases.

I’ve also promised to never create an account on a platform Facebook, now Meta owns. I don’t intend to change that. With that said, I like that they seem to be planning on some form of decentralization and tying it into Mastodon/ActivityPub.</p><hr/></div>\n<div class=\"InDepthNote_inDepthNotes__6s_Z7\"><h3><span class=\"source\">Gergely Orosz:</span> <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/critical-thinking/\">Is Critical Thinking the Most Important Skill for Software Engineers?</a></h3><p>This struck home for me.</p><blockquote>\n<p>I can answer why I felt uneasy about asking what a term like idempotency means: it&#x27;s because I was admitting that I don&#x27;t understand a part of tech jargon. And, to be fair, such admission implies that my professional experience or skills are below the person who knows what this jargon means, and knows how to use it.</p>\n</blockquote><p>In work, it can be hard to admit you don’t know certain terminology, but good teams will not look down on people for asking for clarifications and foster an open environment for everyone to feel comfortable asking questions.</p><p>Gergely also had a good point about the thought leaders that have popped up in the industry.</p><blockquote>\n<p>These people - like myself - share opinions, observations, and views. Many less experienced engineers take these views at face value, assuming as many other people are paying attention to this person, this &quot;famous&quot; person must be right.</p>\n</blockquote><p>It reminds me a lot of the trope “I read it on the internet, so it must be true!”. Some thought leaders are where they’re at because they have studied and used their language and tooling for a long time and know their stuff. Others might not be as experienced. But there’s always a lot of nuance with what they might be pushing. Is it right for you? Despite popular opinion, the true response often comes down to two simple words: “It depends”.</p><p>The best advice really comes down to digging in and asking questions about why people are recommending what they’re recommending.</p><hr/></div>\n<div class=\"InDepthNote_inDepthNotes__6s_Z7\"><h3><span class=\"source\">Jeremy Keith:</span> <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/20113\">Read-only web apps</a></h3><p>I completely agree with Jeremy here.</p><blockquote>\n<p>The most cartoonish misrepresentation of progressive enhancement is that it means making everything work without JavaScript.\nNo. Progressive enhancement means making sure your core functionality works without JavaScript.</p>\n</blockquote><p>My old site on Jekyll worked well with Javascript disabled. There wasn’t much that JS was needed for and most of it was “niceties” rather than key functionality. You could still read all my blog posts and navigate around. I feel like that’s important. I’ve tried to do the same thing on my current blog with Next.js.</p><p>I’ve gone back and forth between having JavaScript disabled and not disabled in the browser and while I certainly wouldn’t expect fancier web apps to work without JavaScript, I SHOULD expect that I should be able to read blog posts on a blog.</p><hr/></div>\n<div class=\"InDepthNote_inDepthNotes__6s_Z7\"><h3><span class=\"source\">David Pierce:</span> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit\">Speed Trap</a></h3><p>I’ll be completely honest and admit that I didn’t know all that much background on the history of AMP and why it was bad as it was. Reading this was enlightening and there were some quotes that stuck out to me.</p><blockquote>\n<p>“If Google said, ‘you must have your homepage colored bright pink on Tuesdays to be the result in Google,’ everybody would do it, because that’s what they need to do to survive,” says Terence Eden, a web standards expert and a former member of the Google AMP Advisory Committee.</p>\n</blockquote><p>This only highlights the power Google has. Media outlets are so dependent on Google that whether they like it or not, they have to play by Google’s rules, no matter how crazy they are, or how often they change them.</p><blockquote>\n<p>As long as anyone played the game, everybody had to. “Google’s strategy is always to create prisoner’s dilemmas that it controls — to create a system such that if only one person defects, then they win,” a former media executive says. As long as anyone was willing to use AMP and get into that carousel, everyone else had to do the same or risk being left out.</p>\n</blockquote><p>This goes back to <a href=\"https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/12/07/chokepoint-capitalism-a-review\">Chokepoint Capitalism</a>, they have them wrapped up so tightly that they’re stuck.</p><blockquote>\n<p>“You meet with a Facebook person and you see in their eyes they’re psychotic,” says one media executive who’s dealt with all the major platforms. “The Apple person kind of listens but then does what it wants to do. The Google person honestly thinks what they’re doing is the best thing.”</p>\n</blockquote><p>I laughed out loud a little bit there.</p><p>The one thing I do remember is Google touting AMP for is for speed. And given how bad the mobile experience on sites can be, I can’t say I don’t understand. I still hold that a well designed site can run beautifully and smoothly on mobile, you just need to design and build it the right way which might not be quite as “profitable”. It seems I’m not the only one with that thought.</p><blockquote>\n<p>AMP, it turned out, wasn’t even that fast. Multiple publishers ran internal tests and found they were able to make pages that loaded more quickly than AMP pages, so long as they were able to rein in the ad load and extra trackers.</p>\n</blockquote><p>At the end of the day, it’s a good thing that we seem to be moving away from AMP.</p><hr/></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3>👨🏼‍💻 Software Development &amp; Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1-rc/\">Announcing TypeScript 5.1 RC</a> - <em>Daniel Rosenwasser</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/14154/webkit-features-in-safari-16-5/\">WebKit Features in Safari 16.5</a> - <em>Jen Simmons</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/array-group\">JavaScript Array Group</a> - <em>David Walsh</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelscodingspot.com/developer-tools/\">My 2023 C# Software Developer Tool List</a> - <em>Michael Shplit</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.claudiobernasconi.ch/2023/05/20/asp-net-core-dotnet-8-preview/\">The Future of ASP.NET Core: .NET 8 Feature Preview</a> - <em>Claudio Bernasconi</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raygun.com/blog/c-sharp-logging-best-practices/\">C# logging: Best practices in 2023 with examples and tools</a> - <em>Shane Duggan</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jonhilton.net/good-blazor-components/\">Good (Blazor) Components are... ?</a> - <em>Jon Hilton</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Podman-Desktop-1.0\">Podman Desktop 1.0 Released As An Alternative To Docker Desktop</a> - <em>Michael Larabel</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changelog.com/posts/still-no-silver-bullet\">There&#x27;s still no silver bullet</a> - <em>Jerod Santo</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2023/05/markdown-images-anti-pattern/\">Markdown images are an anti-pattern</a> - <em>Dave Rupert</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/refactor-your-net-http-clients-to-typed-http-clients\">Refactor your .NET HTTP Clients to Typed HTTP Clients</a> - <em>Tim Deschryver</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.dev/6-css-snippets-every-front-end-developer-should-know-in-2023/\">6 CSS snippets every front-end developer should know in 2023</a> - <em>Adam Argyle</em></p>\n<h3>🖥 Technology &amp; the Internet</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/meta-sells-giphy-to-shutterstock-for-53m-after-uk-divestment-order/\">Following UK antitrust order, Meta sells Giphy to Shutterstock for $53M after buying it for $400M</a> - <em>Paul Sawers</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/2023/04/21/the-secret-list-of-websites/\">“The Secret List of Websites”</a> - <em>Chris Coyier</em></p>\n<h3>📈 Business &amp; Finance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/19/23729711/microsoft-cmo-staff-stock-price-pay\">Microsoft exec tells employees to improve its stock performance in lieu of raises</a> - <em>Emma Roth</em></p>\n<h3>🔬 Science</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/20/1177056829/titanic-scan\">A remarkable new view of the Titanic shipwreck is here, thanks to deep-sea mappers</a> - <em>Rachel Treisman</em></p>\n<h3>🎧 Podcasts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/knowing-when-to-quit-with-world-poker-champion-annie-duke/id1346314086?i=1000591027157\">WorkLife with Adam Grant: Knowing When to Quit with World Poker Champion Annie Duke</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/23/1177772441/is-ai-a-job-killer-or-an-up-skiller\">The Indicator: Is AI a job-killer or an up-skiller?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/the-pandemics-panic-neglect-cycle-isnt-over/\">Make Me Smart #930: The pandemic’s panic-neglect cycle isn’t over</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0048-isaaclevin/\">The Unhandled Exception #48: Coffee and Code - with Isaac Levin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/whats-really-at-the-heart-of-the-debt-limit-debate/\">Marketplace: What’s really at the heart of the debt limit debate?</a></p>\n<h3>🎵 A Song to Leave You With</h3>\n<h4>Dave Hause - Pedal Down</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5-6dQcgmM\" title=\"Dave Hause - Pedal Down\">View on YouTube</a></p>\n            </div>\n        ",

The truth of the matter is that it’s not easy. Sure some posts should be pretty obvious they need to be removed, but there’s also a lot more nuance behind it.</p><blockquote>\n<p>A friend of mine in the trust &amp; safety world once suggested that these conversations would be a lot more useful if everyone had to spend a few days moderating an actual community, and could learn how content moderation is not about “suppressing viewpoints,” but almost always about understanding really complex scenarios in which you have to make decisions in a very limited period of time, with limited information, and where there may not be any “right” answer.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Nails it right on the head. The moderators are having to deal with countless reports in a very short timeframe and are often dealing with content that can be absolutely awful and soul sucking.</p><p>This little game helps show some of the pressures and things the moderators have to deal with. I’d highly recommend giving it a go.</p><hr/></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3>👨🏼‍💻 Software Development &amp; Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/blogs/10-awesome-csharp-refactoring-tips\">10 Awesome C# Refactoring Tips</a> - <em>Assis Zang</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webscope.io/blog/server-components-vs-ssr\">Server Components vs. SSR in Next.js</a> - <em>Jan Koriťák</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/reading-order/\">Solving the CSS layout and source order disconnect</a> - <em>Rachel Andrew</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/custom-properties-beyond-the-root\">CSS Custom Properties Beyond the :root</a> - <em>Matthias Ott</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackify.com/opentelemetry-dotnet/\">A Guide to OpenTelemetry for .NET Engineers</a> - <em>Stackify</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/04/write-better-css-borrow-ideas-javascript-functions/\">Write Better CSS By Borrowing Ideas From JavaScript Functions</a> - <em>Yaphi Berhanu</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/10/02/scrum-versus-kanban.html\">You don&#x27;t need Scrum.

It was the first Star Trek series to have an overarching story across all episodes. With <em>The Original Series</em> and <em>The Next Generation</em>, you could just turn an episode on and generally be fine. DS9 broke that mold which would occasionally make it hard to fully understand what was going on in some episodes. It was also based on a space station rather than a moving starship.</p><p>It dove into some ethical gray areas and didn&#x27;t have the same feel of “Utopia” that was often seen in <em>The Next Generation</em>. It didn&#x27;t pull punches. It also had two of the best villains in all of Trek. While I&#x27;m sure the statute of limitations is over for spoilers given that the series ended over 20 years ago, but I would highly recommend this series.</p><hr/></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3>👨🏼‍💻 Software Development &amp; Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://johnnyreilly.com/2022/09/20/react-usesearchparamsstate\">React: storing state in URL with URLSearchParams</a> <em>(John Reilly)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://endjin.com/blog/2023/01/dotnet-csharp-lazy-async-initialization\">Lazy and once-only C# async initialization</a> <em>(Ian Griffiths)</em></p>\n<h3>🖥 Technology &amp; the Internet</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/apple-rolls-out-ai-narrated-audiobooks-and-its-probably-the-start-of-trend/\">Apple rolls out AI-narrated audiobooks, and it&#x27;s probably the start of a trend</a> <em>(Samuel Axon)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/identity-thieves-bypassed-experian-security-to-view-credit-reports/\">Identity Thieves Bypassed Experian Security to View Credit Reports</a> <em>(KrebsOnSecurity)</em></p>\n<h3>📈 Business &amp; Finance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-coworkers-are-less-ambitious-bosses-adjust-to-the-new-order-11672441067\">Your Coworkers Are Less Ambitious; Bosses Adjust to the New Order</a> <em>(Lindsay Ellis &amp; Ray A.

I remember back around 2000(ish) playing around with building websites in Geocities and Front Page. Going from the clunky, old-school direct properties on the DOM elements to now using CSS stylesheets is such an improvement.</p><p>There are now so many new CSS properties, functions and selectors that I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head around all of them. Making them scale in a large web application is no easy task.</p><blockquote>\n<p>No tool is perfect, and every project and team is different. Whatever approach is taken, establishing foundations that bridge the design gap is a key element to scaling CSS.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The article gives a good overview of some of the things you can try to do to make your CSS more manageable, but the conclusion makes sense. We all do things differently, and teams need to figure out what is best and most sustainable for themselves. Take examples from others, but make sure to do what works.</p><hr/></div>\n<h2>Link Blast</h2>\n<h3>👨🏼‍💻 Software Development &amp; Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://newdevsguide.com/2022/11/13/the-best-csharp-11-feature/\">The Best C# 11 Feature You Don&#x27;t Need</a> <em>(Matt Eland)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tabsoverspaces.com/233907-my-csharp-array-tuple-delegate-declaration-dilemma\">My C# array, tuple, delegate declaration dilemma</a> <em>(Jiří Činčura)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/assertion-scopes-the-one-fluentassertions-feature-you-didnt-know-you-needed\">Assertion Scopes, the one FluentAssertions feature you didn&#x27;t know you needed</a> <em>(Tim Deschryver)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/multi-repository-support-released/\">Multi-repository Support Released!</a> <em>(Jessie Houghton)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelscodingspot.com/asp-net-over-node-js/\">7 Reasons for Startups to Choose ASP.NET Over Node.js</a> <em>(Michael Shpilt)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/\">Craft</a> <em>(Paul Stamatiou)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.dev/web-platform-10-2022/\">New to the web platform in October</a> <em>(Rachel Andrew)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/\">Announcing TypeScript 4.9</a> <em>(Daniel Rosenwasser)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dateo-software.de/blog/improve-your-asp-net-core-controllers\">Learn how to improve your ASP.NET Core controllers with these principles</a> <em>(Dennis Frühauff)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vived.io/new-hook-is-coming-to-react-frontend-weekly-vol-109/\">Make use of &#x27;use&#x27;

There are also now the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0\">minimal APIs</a> that can make things super simple.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day though, I feel this is kind of a personal taste thing with no &quot;right&quot; answer. Both Node.js and .NET are fantastic platforms to get up and running with so companies and developers should really go with whichever they&#x27;re more comfortable with.
