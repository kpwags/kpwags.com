I can't believe this is the 50th issue of my current take on my reading logs. This week I read about the renaissance of CSS, issues at SpaceX, the cancellation of a promising new nuclear power station, and more.

    > CSS has been undergoing a quiet renaissance lately. Lots of big features which previously required an external tool to use, are now native parts of the language, and its growing more and more all the time. If you haven't used CSS in a long time, for whatever reason, now is the time to take a look again.

    It‚Äôs really amazing how far CSS has come recently with all the new features that make both big and little things easier.

    I agree with both [Thomas](https://indieweb.social/@nachtfunke/110912228740815266) and Jim on this.

    > The web‚Äôs low barrier to entry led me to a career that has been a boon for my life. I hope it can do the same for others.

    While certain parts of web design and development can be far more difficult than others, the tools available for everyone to build their own website have only grown better and easier. Long past are the times of Geocities and MySpace customization.

    I agree with some of them more than others, but this one stuck with me:

    > Sometimes you don't know the whole story. I have seen some cases where a person just can't do their job properly. They are burdened with tons of tasks and doing work for 2 people.

    With both work and life, we don‚Äôt necessarily know what others are going through. I know I sometimes get annoyed with the timeliness of responses from a certain team at work, but also have to take a deep breath and remember that the team is currently understaffed (they‚Äôre working on it) and often overworked. We‚Äôre on the same (larger) team and want the projects to succeed and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important.
