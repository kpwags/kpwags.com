This week I read about how mistakes made in 1999 are still relevant today, .NET 8 RC1 being released, and the never-ending scam that is public funding for sports stadiums.

    I remember reading [Field of Schemes by Neil Demause & Joanna Cagan](https://bookshop.org/books/field-of-schemes-how-the-great-stadium-swindle-turns-public-money-into-private-profit-revised/9780803260160) several years ago and the following excerpt always stood out to me.

    > As St. Paul Pioneer Press columnist Edward Lotterman wrote on the absurdities of TIFS: "My wife and I have often talked about a small addition that would extend the back porch the full width of the house. It would be nice if the government would give us the money to do this. The value of the house would increase and so would our taxes. The higher taxes would pay the government back eventually, so it wouldn't cost taxpayers anything. It seems like a great idea, but for some reason the government is not willing to step up to our plate. We threatened to move to Portland or Charlotte if we don't get help, but officials just laughed."

    Public money funding private sports stadium is a racket and any and all proposals should be immediately rejected.
