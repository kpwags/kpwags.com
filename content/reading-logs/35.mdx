A Lot of software development links this week as well as a history of the fall of Google Reader and more.

    I can relate to a lot of what Nate talks about. I‚Äôve written plenty of code that I revisit later only to wonder what I was thinking when I wrote it. I‚Äôm sure other developers have thought the same thing about my code and their own. When we write code, we are always trying to write the best code we can, but time constraints, vague requirements all get in the way.

    > However, with time, most engineers end up maintaining code they or someone else created long ago. And when that happens, what was hidden now becomes a headache.

    I think it‚Äôs important to just be mindful of the code we write and do it in a way that minimizes headaches as best we can later down the road.

    I was really sad when Google killed off Reader. This was an interesting read about the history of Google Reader and how it formed and how it got pushed aside for Google‚Äôs push into social (which has since also been killed off).

    Since Reader was shuttered, I switched around between different services, but now am quite happy using [FeedBin](https://www.feedbin.com). So while losing Reader sucked, it at least has shown that people want a good RSS reader. And with the Twitter drama, I think blogs and RSS are starting to make a bit of a resurgence.
