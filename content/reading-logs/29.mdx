I‚Äôve finally started going through all my RSS feeds, so there‚Äôs a lot to this week‚Äôs log. The topics are all over the place from the IRS doing what it should have done from the beginning, to a boneheaded decision to add some new top level domains, to the US Supreme Court saving Section 230.

    The IRS should have done this from the beginning but the tax prep companies lobbied hard against it. Their greed in hiding the free options is who they have to blame for this. Here‚Äôs hoping they follow through for the 2023 tax season.
