Between a weekend trip and my site update, this has been 3 weeks in the making. This log we look at the passing of a folk legend, Microsoft reverting to its old ways, Microsoft facing a hurdle in its Activision acquisition, some chatty parrots, and more.

    I grew up with my dad listening to Gordon Lightfoot quite a bit. It gave me a real appreciation for his music. I have several vinyl records of his and have seen him in concert. The world has lost a fantastic musician.
