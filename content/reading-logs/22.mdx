    I've been guilty of not properly handling my site without JavaScript enabled. I didn't even necessarily thing about what happens if it fails to load at all. It's important to think of the edge cases to help produce a good experience. There are obviously some functionality that require JavaScript, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the user and not have some fallback in place, even if it means alerting the user they need to turn on scripts.
