It‚Äôs another double issue as I was away in Maryland last weekend. Lots of stuff in here from many classic games being no longer available, new C# & .NET features, some CSS tricks, and an unfortunate outcome in the FTC vs. Microsoft case regarding their acquisition of Activision.

    This goes along with the [tragedy of Star Trek: Prodigy](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/06/27/star-trek-prodigy-what-a-bummer) and my push to [own my media](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/07/12/random-thoughts-on-owning-things). There are so many good games of the past that are hard to come by. And there are some that are only available via some probably less-than-legal methods which is shame.

    > Now, imagine if the Democrats were in control over the House, and they formed a committee that sent a similar subpoena to Fox News or to the NY Post ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù either of those orgs to detail how it made editorial choices, what stories it would cover, what opinion writers it would publish, or what stories would go on the front page with what headlines?

    Mike hits the nail right on the head here. I am no fan of Fox News. I think it has made America dumber, and has helped divide this country by feeding people so many lies and bullshit over the years. I also don‚Äôt want to see the government going after them and pushing them to determine what they cover and how they cover it. And while I am no fan of Meta either, Meta should be free to moderate Threads as they see fit.
