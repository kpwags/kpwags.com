    This makes me so excited. I know it only applies to Safari right now, but this is the last bastion for me to consider SASS or LESS. I'm really looking forward to this reaching Chromium and Firefox.

    I didn't hate Halo 5 or it's story. I didn't even completely hate the antagonism between Locke and the Master Chief. (I think it could've been done better, but that's another topic) But 343 really missed an opportunity on the Cortana storyline with Halo Infinite.
