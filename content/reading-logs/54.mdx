    I have to completely agree with his take.

    > Pick tools because they work well for your team and your project, not because you have their stickers on your laptop.

    When building anything, build with what makes sense to you, the team youâ€™re working with, and whatever youâ€™re trying to build. Not every tool makes sense for every project. Choose what you like and have fun building.
