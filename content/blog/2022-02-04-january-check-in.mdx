I can't believe it's already February. It feels like January just came and went.

January as a whole wasn't a super busy month. The biggest thing that happened was me taking an all-grain brewing class at the end of the month. Over the course of the last several years I've been brewing beer at home as a hobby, but I've been limited to extract brewing. It can turn out some good brews, but I know there is so much more I can do moving beyond extract and mashing the grains myself. I was hoping to learn how to do it before the pandemic, and when my local homebrew shop was offering a class, I signed right up. It was a good class and I am now itching to try my hand at an all-grain brew. Iâ€™m planning on brewing this weekend but it will be one more extract brew before I try my hand at some more advanced recipes.

Other than that, not much to really report so far.
