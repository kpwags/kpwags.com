The fall season has begun. The weather has [started to chill](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/09/16/summer-is-fading) which is thankful since our AC still needs repairing or replacement.

## Started Writing More

Towards the end of the month, I decided I wanted to start to write more, and made a goal of writing a bit every day. It hasn't been that long, but so far, I've been sticking with it. I'm not always writing a lot, but the thought is to get something down every day. More and or better can come as time progresses I figure.

## A Dull Month

Overall, it's been a pretty dull month, which isn't a bad thing. The fall hockey season started up and I spent a lot of evenings on the couch watching TV and reading with my wife. I started "attacking" my podcast queue and have slowly been making a little bit of progress.

I'm not mad about a quiet month, definitely has its plusses.
