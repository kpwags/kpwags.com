Summer here in the Northeast USA is winding down and I couldn't be happier.

I don't know how people like summer. I mean I get it, warm weather and sun. But the weather is always too warm. Mid-to-high 80s and hotter and it's unbearable to me. I sit or stand still in the shade and all I do is sweat. It doesn't even have to be in the 90s or even above 100. It just makes me miserable.

As I'm writing this, it's in the low 70s with a nice breeze. I'm sitting out on my front porch with a glass of whiskey soaking it all in. It's been a gorgeous day and I'm looking forward to more of this for the foreseeable future.

To me, this is the perfect weather. Not too hot, comfortable enough to just sit outside in shorts and a tee shirt and enjoy the fresh air. As the temperature dips in the evening, can even enjoy some fires in the fire pit.

Some people love summer. I say phooey...give me a nice autumn day.
