A song that's been on heavy repeat is blink-182's latest single *One More Time*. I love the song for so many reasons.

I loved blink-182 in high school and college. They were the first band I saw live in concert. Since then, they've broken up, gotten back together, changed members, and now are back to their most famous lineup of Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, & Travis Barker. So when this song came up on my YouTube homepage, I watched and listened to it and fell in love with the song for a multitude of reasons.

Outside the nostalgia factor of seeing Mark, Tom & Travis back together, the song itself exudes meaning. Relatively recently, Mark had a nasty bout with cancer, and farther in the past, Travis survived a plane crash. All of us, no matter who we are, are on this earth for a finite period of time. As morbid as it is, we don't know when our last day will be.

The song talks about that and how easy it is to take tomorrow for granted, and the importance of making sure that those you love and care about know how important they are to you.

Needless to say, I love the song and the meaning behind it.
