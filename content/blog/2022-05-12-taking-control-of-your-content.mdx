It's been almost 4 years since I got rid of my Instagram account which my last tie to the Facebook ecosystem. With the news of Elon Musk buying Twitter, I've rethought where my blog fits into my internet presence.

Given that I suspect Twitter might very well take a turn for the worse with Elon at the helm, it reminds me of all the cases where platforms disappeared out from under users. Some are still around as a shell of themselves, others are gone completely.

That's one of the many beauties of having your own site. The platform is yours. It will only disappear if you want it to. You have full control over it which means you can tinker with how you display your content. You can add more forms of content, you can change how it's displayed, the web is your oyster.

I know I'm not the only one who believes this, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/29/rss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="https://cagrimmett.com/thoughts/2022/04/26/why-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Chuck Grimmet</a> and many others feel the same way. So go out there, build your blog and control your own content.
