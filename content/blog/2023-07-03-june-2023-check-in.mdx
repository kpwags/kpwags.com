Half the year is over. This month also had me surviving another trip around the sun.

## Site Updates

The one thing I've spent doing this month is moving my various lists ([TV](https://kpwags.com/tv), [Movies](https://kpwags.com/movies), [Now](https://kpwags.com/now), [Video Games](https://kpwags.com/video-games), [Bookshelf](https://kpwags.com/bookshelf), [Podcasts](https://kpwags.com/listening), & my new [Music](https://kpwags.com/music) page) is to put the data into Notion and use it's API to load the data. This will save me the hassle of updating the JSON that currently populates it. I started with my new music page and now I've gotten TV, books, video games and the now pages all updated. Last ones are movies and podcasts.

## New York City

It's become somewhat of a tradition, but Lauren and I spent a long weekend in New York City for my birthday. We seldomly go there with a plan, we just see what's going on and go from there.

This year we went to MoMA to see a Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit Lauren had been wanting to see. It was interesting but I feel sadly that some of it is just lost on me.

A lot of the rest of the trip was spent wandering around, checking out different restaurants, whiskey bars, and even a new brewery. Time was also spent at various parks people watching and reading. The weather was mostly good too. It wasn't too hot, it only really rained for a little bit and we were inside MoMA for the storm.

Next year's birthday will be a little weird as I'll be hitting the big 4-0.

## Back at it as a Goalie

The league I play goalie in has started back up, so I'm now spending more nights at the rink, this time guarding the net. I'm glad to have given my hip flexor a month and a half break, but am looking forward to getting better in net.

I ended up playing a game towards the end of the month in a higher league as an emergency sub. We ended up winning the game too. The defense in front of me was a huge help and deserves most of the credit, but I felt like I played relatively well given the advanced skill level. Only helps me get better too!

## Finally Starting My Sleeve

For the last 5+ years, I have been wanting to get a space-themed sleeve on my right arm. I finally found an artist to work on getting it started. My first session was last week and the work so far looks amazing. There's still plenty to go, but I can't wait for the final result.
