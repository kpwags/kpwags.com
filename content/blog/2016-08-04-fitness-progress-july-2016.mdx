This month was pretty much a complete wash. I didn't really progress at all.

Granted I didn't really regress so I guess I'll count it as a win. Between 2 weddings, the dining room, plans every weekend, I just couldn't get into a routine. At the end of the day though, I should have tried harder to maintain some kind of consistency.

My weight has been ticking up a little bit and I’m not quite sure what my actual body fat percentage is. I use a Fitbit Aria scale every morning to weigh myself and all of a sudden it’s really just jumping around. Some days it’s in the 25% range, the next it’s down below 23%. I know the bioelectrical impedance it uses to measure isn’t the most accurate, but before I felt like it was at least consistent enough to give myself a good idea of where I’m at. Now, I’m not sure. I did buy calipers to help, but I need to learn the best way to use them. The instructions they came with weren’t completely clear.
