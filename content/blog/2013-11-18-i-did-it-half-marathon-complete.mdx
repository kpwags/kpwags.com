I did it. After all the hard work and exercise, I ran a half marathon yesterday! From barely being able to run a mile three and a half years ago, to 13.1 miles…it's a journey I am incredibly proud of.

My finishing time was 2:15:15 with an average pace of 10:18/mile. I was doing really well to start, but the last 4 or so miles really kicked my ass. Either way though, I'm proud of my accomplishment and would encourage everyone to give something like this a try. It's an amazing feeling.

My next goal…a full marathon…maybe next year.
