Lately I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction and have been watching some documentaries like *The Roosevelts*. I’ve found them to be incredibly interesting, but also very much in depth with a lot of information to digest. Sometimes it feels like I’m back in middle school, but I’ve started to take notes on what I’ve been reading and watching.

With reading, I’ve just been making notes about what I’m reading and capturing quotes that stand out. My iPhone makes the quotes easy as I can use the OCR functionality of the camera to copy the text off the page or off my Kindle to copy into my note.

With documentaries, it’s much the same, just capturing various different notes and factoids that I see and find interesting.

I’m not sure I’ll ever come back and dig into them, but I’m always trying to learn and it often feels like writing down some of what I read and watch helps my grasp things better.
