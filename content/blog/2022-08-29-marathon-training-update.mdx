Well, it's been just about a month since I started training for the 2022 Philadelphia Marathon. Overall it's been going well.

I'm now on my 5th week of training and so far, so good. I've been having to get up at the crack of dawn to get my runs in before the heat gets turned up to eleven, but I've been doing it. It's been a bit of an adjustment doing distance as for the last several years I've been focusing more on just running more and generally sticking to the 3-4 mile range. I'm running 4 days a week now and 3 of the 4 are 5+ miles. The long runs on Saturday are gonna start to be a challenge, but I welcome it.

The only hiccup I had was 2 weeks ago when I missed a run thanks to aggrivating my groin playing hockey. I was, and am still a little concerned over it, but I've been able to get my miles in without it bothering me so crossing my fingers ü§ûüèª in hopes that I'm not going to aggrivate it further. I'm not going to give up hockey for 3 months, but I'm hoping that the two activities don't end up colliding.

I'm 81 miles into my training...time to keep it going!
