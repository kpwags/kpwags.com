May was a bit of a frustrating month, but I can’t fully point my finger at why exactly. I ended up tweaking a muscle early in the month that limited my physical activities, but not much else really jumps out at me as to why the month felt off.

## Injury Issues

My left hip flexor tends to be relatively tight. I need to stretch it more, but keep forgetting, and never really get around to it. It’s led to some painful days following hockey games, particularly games where I play as the goalie. Normally, the pain goes away after a day or two and I go back to normal. Early in the month I was in a battle for the puck in the corner and ended up falling awkwardly. Queue a 3-4 week healing process. It’s now June and it finally seems to be back to normal.

Just stunk since I couldn’t run or lift like I normally like to. Funny thing is that hockey didn’t bother me too much, though I haven’t been playing in net since we’re between seasons in that league.

I just need to remember to stretch, but if it keeps happening, a visit to an ortho might be in order.

## It’s No Wonder I Never Finish a Side Project

It’s no wonder I never finish a side project, I currently started playing around with a new side project.

I’ve been frustrated with the website my hockey league uses to manage my teams and what not. The site is absolutely awful and I know teammates and other team captains and players hate the system.

I’ve been playing around with how I might go about building a similar system that has a much better UI and is much more user-friendly. I have no idea where I’m going to go with it, but why not I guess.

## Everything Else

Not much else has been going on, it’s been mostly quiet. My wife and I went to a nice whiskey pairing dinner, a Gaslight Anthem concert, and even a Kentucky Derby party. But other than that, it’s generally been nice quiet evenings at home. I’ve been spending a lot of evenings out on my porch since it’s been so nice out. Not looking forward to the hot and humid weather that’s going to mess that all up.

## Monthly Round-Up

**🏃🏼‍♂️ Running & Biking**

- **Running:** Given the hip flexor, I only managed 10.26 miles.
- **Biking:** I took a 25 mile bike ride early in the month...so progress?

**🏋🏼‍♂️ Lifting**

- Still doing the 5/3/1 program, but because of the hip flexor, I’ve slowed some.
