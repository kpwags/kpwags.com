September seemed to fly by pretty quickly, but it was definitely a good month. I enjoyed a week away on vacation and felt like I got a lot accomplished.

Month started off well and I was feeling very productive. It helped that hockey has been on a slight hiatus so I was able to spend more nights at home. I used that time to finish up my blog redesign. I actually just got it deployed and switched over. I'm now using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host it and the setup process was pretty easy once I got the kinks ironed out.

Towards the end of August, I started using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for notes. I'm still not entirely sure how I like it, but the one thing I've started doing it creating new journal notes every day tracking what I would like to do, what I did, and links to some of the more interesting things I've read. Even if I end up moving back to my synched Dropbox folder with Markdown Files, I think I'm going to continue this.

In mid-September, my wife and I went to Cape May for a week on vacation. We rented a condo on the beach and took a nice week away to do basically nothing. Well, maybe not quite nothing, but it was a much needed break. We ended up visiting several breweries and wineries, and were able to meet up with my parents one afternoon for lunch and some beers. I brought several books hoping to read some while there, but I ended up working on my fitness tracker side project far more than I had planned. It worked out because I was able to get quite a bit done on it. There's still a ways to go, but progress is progress. Yes, I spent a bunch of time programming, but Lauren and I were able to spend the week the way we wanted, so I count that as a fantastic vacation. It was nice to come back home and sleep in my own bed again though.

While I didn't end up finishing a single book while on vacation, I did finish _Think Again_ by Adam Grant shortly after getting home. I thought it was a great book, and plan on writing something more about it over the next week or so.

Since getting back, I've realized I've put on more weight than I would really like, so I think I'm going to be really focusing this next month on cutting back my alcohol consumption. It's been a little too easy for me to enjoy the evening with a beer or two. It's been adding up and I think it's been sabotaging my attempt to get into better shape.

For October, I'm really hoping to make more progress on my fitness tracker.

### Summary

**Staying Active:** Not much hockey this month, but outside of vacation, I've been lifting and running. I've run more miles in September than in any month this year April.

**Development:** Finished up most of my blog re-write. Made good progress on my fitness tracker. And not to muddy the waters, but have started putzing around with moving Digital Family Cookbook over to .NET Core.

**Reading:** I finished _Think Again_ by Adam Grant and also was able to go through my Pocket list and read a bunch of articles I've marked for read later.

**Write More:** I wrote one post on my thoughts about [software subscriptions](https://kpwags.com/2021/09/04/on-software-subscriptions.html).
