We always seem to be concerned with China & TikTok, yet completely ignore what’s going on in our backyard. The US can ban TikTok tomorrow, but if China wants data, it’s not hard for them to just go out and buy the data.

> Even though the data is technically “anonymized” (we can’t see the age, income, or ethnicity of a specific visitor, let alone their name), the pinpoint locations of where they spend their days and nights makes educated guesswork pretty easy.

Anonymized data in bulk can lose its anonymous status pretty easily. This was proven [after the Edward Snowden leaks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/surprise-surprise-my-online-metadata-actually-reveals-where-ive-been/), and it continues now.
