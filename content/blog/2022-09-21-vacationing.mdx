My wife and I are currently enjoying a week down in Cape May, New Jersey and it's exactly what I want it to be. A week of doing basically nothing.

We've spent some time going to breweries, some time at wineries, but overall, we're spending our time our way, doing whatever we want, sometimes nothing at all.

I've been spending some of my time reading, working on side projects, and just relaxing to take my mind off of things. It's nice to not have to worry about work and everything else going on in our sometimes crazy life. But hey, I guess that's what vacation is for.
