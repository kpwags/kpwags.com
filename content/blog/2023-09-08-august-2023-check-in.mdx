August was a mostly uneventful month, which seems to be par for the course for me. I'm good with that though, I like being able to take it easy...especially with this heat.

## No Marathon for Me

I was looking forward to going for the marathon this year. Unfortunately my body had other plans. I can't say for a fact whether it's the heat or something else, but I was having a hard time not running out of breath. It is concerning and I'll see what happens when the heat breaks at some point...hopefully soon.

## Air Conditioner Goes Kaput

Speaking of heat, we found out the central air system in our house has gone the way of the dodo bird. Not what we wanted to hear, but we were told that a replacement is needed. They could fix it, but given the cost for the part, it's not worth the money. I have no reason to doubt them, but will be getting a second look at it. With how expensive it is, I want to be sure. Plus it'll get me another list of quotes. Needless to say, with it being 90¬∫+ out, it's been roasting in here. Ugh.

## Catching Some Shows

At the beginning of the month, we saw Seth Myers up in Bethlehem, PA. It was a good show with a lot of great jokes. I've always loved his humor and would highly recommend seeing him if you ever get the chance.

At the end of the month, we drove up to Stroudsburg, PA to see The Menzingers.

This was the 5th time I've seen them and they've been awesome every time. It was also nice because we spent the night up there so we went up early and checked out some breweries and wineries that we otherwise wouldn't have gone to.
