One of these days I'm going to stop itching to redesign my site.

I'm always tinkering around with my site. I see other people's personal sites and see ideas I'm interested in potentially implementing. I'm adding or adjusting new features, tweaking the look and feel, and who knows what else.

In the last week, I completely redesigned my homepage and how I lay out my blog, reading logs, & book notes. This is exactly what I'm talking about, I can't just let things be and focus on the content. I have to be tweaking things. I have a whole bunch of [unfinished side projects](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/09/23/the-strange-inability-to-finish-a-project) that I could be spending time on, instead.

I was even planning a complete redesign of my site, but have tabled that...thankfully I guess.

My goal to write every day has started to provide me with a steady flow of content and posts that I'll have for the site. It's also taken up some of the time I might've originally spent tinkering. Maybe I can recapture some of my time and maybe I can finally shift my focus to finishing one of the side projects that are on my list.
