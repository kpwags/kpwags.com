I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I seem to be unable to finish a project. I have a handful side projects I've been puttering around with, but haven't been able to see them through to completion.

Here are my current list of side projects I've worked on in some manner, shape or form:

- **Digital Family Cookbook** - This is a React/.NET recipe management tool. It's probably about 80-90% complete. The UI could use some improvements and other tweaks.
- **Card Organizer** - This is a Blazor web app to manage and organize my sports card collection. It's probably sitting around 60-70% complete.
- **Gamifit** - This is a React/.NET app to track my fitness I've been working on. I've been using a bunch of different apps that all do a good job, but never do what I want, so I've started this. It's had a few different iterations and isn't that far along.
- **Leegtastic** - This is also a React/.NET app to run small sports leagues. I decided to tinker with building one since the site my hockey league runs is absolutely awful. It's in the early phases.
- **Astro rebuild of my site** - Never finished this one, and probably won't. I've been considering it, but for the moment I think I'll be sticking with Next.js.
- **Personal site work** - I'm less inclined to include this as I'm always tinkering and there really is no "final product".

I start working on one thing, and then get the urge to switch to a different project. I start that, and then end up switching to a different one.

At my 9-5, I'll finish every project or task I'm assigned...at home it's like the opposite. I mean sure, at work I have to if I want to keep my job, it's just kinda funny I can't do the same at home.

I really should just bite the bullet and dedicate myself to something and just push it out the door.
