Of course the month of my vacation is the month that seems to fly by the fastest.

## Hockey Starting Back Up

Since the teams I play on either got knocked out of the playoffs early or missed them entirely, I've had almost a month to a month and a half of no hockey. Mid-September that changed and 2 of the 3 leagues have started back up with the 3rd starting up mid-October.

## Vacation

In the middle of the month, I went on vacation to Cape May, New Jersey. It was a glorious week where I relaxed, checked out the local breweries and wineries, read a bunch, and just re-charged. I was sad to see it end, but super glad to be back in my own bed.

## Not Running the Marathon

I hate quitting and giving up on things, but I've come to the conclusion that the marathon is not going to happen for me this year. My long runs have not been going well and I'm feeling absolutely broken after them. I was doing well on my medium (6-7 miles) runs, but the long 13+ mile runs were becoming too much for me. I was looking forward to trying to beat 5 hours, but at the end of the day, the toll it was putting on my body just wasn't worth it to me. I don't recover like I used to.

## Boosted

At the end of the month I got the new COVID-19 booster. COVID isn't done with us and I wanted to make sure I got myself protected. I'd highly recommend you do so too.

## Monthly Round-Up
