Hope everyone had a good Christmas. Mine was definitely a good one. It was nice to be able to spend the day with my family. For a first Christmas (well, Married Christmas) with Lauren, I couldn’t have asked for a better Christmas.

Christmas Eve Lauren and I had a delicious seafood dinner, a tradition we started last year. We had crab cakes (homemade of course), scallops, clams, and asparagus which were all delicious. After dinner we went over to Lauren’s parents to spend time with them and exchange gifts.

Christmas morning, I made us a delicious breakfast which was followed by Lauren and I exchanging gifts. I also was floored by what Lauren got me. I ran my first half marathon in November which for me was a big accomplishment so to get this, was absolutely amazing.

It is amazing to have a nice remembrance of it. It was an amazing gift from the best wife ever.

We spent the early afternoon with Lauren’s family and dinner with my family. It was a great day overall, mostly for its simplicity. We didn’t do anything fancy, just spend quiet time with family. Those always seem to be the best times.
