October was a good month. I spent the latter half of it in Aruba and had a great time. But outside Aruba, the month was mostly quiet.

## Aruba

Aruba was gorgeous. I wrote about my trip [here](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/10/29/aruba) and was happy to spend 2 weeks in paradise with my wife for our 10 year anniversary. I spent so much of it just enjoying the rest and relaxation. I was happy to come back home to my own bed though.

## Writing More

One of the things I said I was going to do at the end of September was to write more, and to write every day. While I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve succeeded in writing every day, I have written something almost every day. I only missed 9 days, and 2 of them were travel days to and from Aruba. A lot of what I wrote were either blog posts or draft blog posts that may or may not ever see the light of day. I did get back into writing a story I started back in June. I‚Äôm not sure how long the story will end up being, but I plan on spending a lot of time on it in November for NaNoWriMo. Not sure how many blog posts I‚Äôll end up writing, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll write some.

## Getting Back into Fitness

When I got back from Aruba and weighed in, I realized I had started to slip a little bit with my fitness goals. I have no issue with letting go while I was in Aruba. It‚Äôs a vacation and we only have 1 life to live. Enjoy it. But getting back, I have started to buckle down and pay closer attention to my diet and exercise habits. I‚Äôm hoping to continue that into November...and...the holidays.

## Analog Journaling

I had written a month or so ago about my back and forth on whether I liked [analog or digital](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/09/28/analog-versus-digital). I decided that for my journaling I was going to go back to a moleskine-like notebook and physically write about my days. I have to say I like it. Even during vacation, I spent a little bit of time before bed writing about my days.
