I wrote a post earlier this year about how [Gary Bettman and the NHL are Cowards](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/06/24/gary-bettman-and-the-nhl-are-cowards) for getting rid of the specialty jerseys before games. Well now they're also [banning the use of pride tape](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/12/1205476006/nhl-bans-pride-tape-backlash).

Instead of standing up for the LGBT community and against bigotry, they're caving to it. I said it before, and I'll say it again.

<p style={{ fontSize: '2rem', textAlign: 'center', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Hockey is for Everyone</p>

If anyone wants to play hockey, they should be able to regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. If they just want to cheer on their favorite team, they should be able to do that without fear of discrimination or fear of attack. They should be able to cheer with reckless abandon like the rest of us.

Gary Bettman and the NHL are absolute cowards for cowing to the bigots and the assholes.

I'll again add Brian Burke's quote:

> I repeat that I am extremely disappointed. I wish players would understand that the pride sweaters are about inclusion and welcoming everybody. A player wearing pride colors or tape isnâ€™t endorsing a set of values or enlisting in a cause! He is saying you are welcome here. And you are. In ever single NHL building.

Wearing the pride jersey isn't about them, it's about welcoming the LGBT community and letting them know they're welcome, and that hockey is for everyone. It's incredibly disappointing to see the sport I love take such a backwards step.

I hope Scott Laughton and other NHL players follow through and [defy NHL's ban](https://allphly.com/scott-laughton-says-hell-still-wear-pride-tape-regardless-of-nhl-ban/).

I love the sport of hockey. I play the sport 2-3 times a week and want to see the sport grow. Sadly, all too often they seem to be very good at shooting themselves in the foot.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go buy myself some [pride tape](https://pridetape.com/) for my sticks.
