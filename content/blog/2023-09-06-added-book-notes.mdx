You might have noticed that I added a new section to my page called “Book Notes”, and RSS subscribers might have noticed the same thing. Inspired by a [Mastodon post by Matthias Ott](https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/110983854141456413), I decided to add something more than quick notes on the books I read.

For some books, probably not all, I’m hoping to add more notes and details about what I thought of the book. These notes will show up on the book notes page and my general RSS feed. I also added a separate [RSS feed](https://kpwags.com/rss/booknotes_feed.xml) specifically for book notes. You can also go right to the book’s book notes page from my full [bookshelf page](https://kpwags.com/bookshelf) if you see the link titled “Book Notes”.
