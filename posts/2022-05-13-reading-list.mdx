I've been going through my podcast backlog so this week has a lot of podcasts.

[**Building Software for Yourself (Podcast)**](https://changelog.com/podcast/455) - I build a lot of things that I have no idea if anyone will ever see or use. I find it a great way to learn and improve my chops. <span className="domain-name">(changelog.com)</span>

[**Welcome to the Era of the Hyper-Surveilled Office**](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/09/welcome-to-the-era-of-the-hyper-surveilled-office) - I'm glad I work for an employer who trusts us to get our work done and doesn't feel the need to constantly surveil us. I feel like a good manager will know when one of their reports is working and when they're not. I also take the privilege of working remotely seriously. [As I posted earlier](https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/04/28/two-years-of-remote-work), I don't think I would ever want to go into an office again so not abusing the ability to work from home is important to me. <span className="domain-name">(economist.com)</span>

[**Will the future of AI repeat past injustices (Podcast)?**](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/will-the-future-of-ai-repeat-past-injustices/) - Interesting podcast talking about how AI is taking advantage of poorer people in countries like Venezuela. <span className="domain-name">(marketplace.org)</span>

[**I Am Not a Bot (Podcast)**](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/emh36dn/178-i-am-not-a-bot) - I loved Team Fortress 2 and the bots ruin it. <span className="domain-name">(gimletmedia.com)</span>

[**The Future of Libraries (Podcast)**](https://www.techdirt.com/2021/09/07/techdirt-podcast-episode-297-future-libraries/) - I love libraries and it saddens me that publishers are making it hard and expensive to enter and loan digital books. <span className="domain-name">(techdirt.com)</span>

[**All You Need is Nudge (Podcast)**](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/all-you-need-is-nudge/) - Having just read *Nudge*, it was nice to hear more thoughts from Dr. Richard Thayler about the background behind it. <span className="domain-name">(freakonomics.com)</span>

[**Ordering CSS Declarations**](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/ordering-css-delcarations/) - I've always tended to put my CSS declarations in groups based on what they style. This is an interesting take that might make me re-think how I order things. <span className="domain-name">(jim-nielson.com)</span>
