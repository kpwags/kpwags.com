            I had figured out a while ago that publicly funded sports stadiums were a raw deal. This book didn’t tell me anything I didn’t know other

            Having lived through 2020, I understood that the US Government royally screwed up its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reading this book
            gave me a better idea of why the different departments struggled to get a handle on it.
