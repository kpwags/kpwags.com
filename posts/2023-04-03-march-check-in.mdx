March wasn't a particularly bad month, had a wedding a whiskey dinner.

## Getting My Camera Out Again
At the beginning of March, my Sister-in-Law got married and as a wedding gift, I offered to take some photos of her special day. It gave me the chance to get my camera out and enjoy my hobby. I still need to go through the photos, and I'm thinking it will be a good chance to give [Darkroom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746) a try.

## Whiskey Dinner
Later in the month, Lauren and I went to Bloom Southern Kitchen again for another food and drink pairing. This time it was what they called a ‚ÄúSingle Malt Showcase‚Äù where we tasted some single malt whiskeys from India, Japan and more. It was another good time and we're planning on going to another in May and then again in June.

## Digging into Astro
You know the saying that developers can't finish a side project? Yeah, that trend continues as I've been splitting my time between Blazor and re-writing my blog using Astro 2.0. I'm actually pretty impressed with how easy it is to implement. I miss bits and pieces of React & Next.js, but man is Astro fast. I'm not sure if I'll end up switching platforms, but I'm liking the ease of developer experience.

## Continuing Blazor
I've been making good progress with my card organizer in Blazor. I'm amazed at how fast it is to build an app with Blazor. It's taken a slight back seat with my blog rewrite in Astro, but I'm getting it into a good place.

## Monthly Round-Up

**üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running & Biking**

- **Running:** I ended up running 35 miles in March. Still trying to do longer runs in the hopes of making the transition to marathon training in August.
- **Biking:** Nope

**üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lifting**

- Was able to finally hit the 1,000 lbs. club. I hit new PRs on both deadlifts (400 lbs.) & Bench Press (240 lbs.). I've since dropped weight a bit to focus more on reps than sheer weight.
