I just moved my reading logs into their own page and unfortunately I'm dealing with a few side effects caused by it.

I'm hoping to fix them over the next couple days. The biggest issue is the redirects. Moving the reading logs, I have redirects in place that work locally, but aren't working in production. It's an annoying bug that I'm gonna have to experiment with to fix.

The other thing I added was additional RSS feeds. The default feed before includes both blog posts and reading logs. I also added feeds for the reading logs and blog posts separately. You can click the RSS feed icon in the site header to choose your feed.
