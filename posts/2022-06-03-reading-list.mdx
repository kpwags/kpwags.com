Spent a bit of time this weekend looking at CSS and web development. Pixels, rems, typography &amp; more!

🧑🏼‍💻 [**The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility**](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) - Josh does a great job in this article talking about when you should use rems and when you should use pixels, and why. <span className="domain-name">(joshwcomeau.com)</span>

🅰 [**Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) - I've been wanting to improve the typography on what I design and develop. This can help. <span className="domain-name">(smashingmagazine.com)</span>

🤔 [**Where the f*ck is native CSS nesting?**](https://benfrain.com/where-the-f-is-native-css-nesting/) - I'd like to know as well. Hopefully soon as it'd be nice to clean up some CSS. <span className="domain-name">(benfrain.com)</span>

💾 [**What's in a monorepo**](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/31/whats-in-a-monorepo/) - A nice bit talking about the benefits of using a monorepo. <span className="domain-name">(chriscoyier.net)</span>

🎚 [**Dark Mode Toggles Should be a Browser Feature**](https://www.bram.us/2022/05/25/dark-mode-toggles-should-be-a-browser-feature/) - I agree with this. It would be nice as a developer to not have to duplicate code to support both the browser being set to dark mode and the user selecting something different than what the browser is set to. <span className="domain-name">(bram.us)</span>
