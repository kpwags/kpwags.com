This past week Paramount announced the [cancellation of *Star Trek: Prodigy*](https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-prodigy-cancelled-no-season-2-paramount-plus-1850571256). And to make matters even worse, they have since pulled the series off of its Paramount+ service.

HEY! I was watching that!

*Prodigy* had been on my backlog for a while, but since Paramount had given a green light to season 2, I didn't rush to watch it figuring I had time. Then the news came out last week about them cancelling it and also pulling it from the service. Saturday and Sunday Lauren and I started binging it. We got 14 episodes into its 20 episode run before time ran out. Now I'm stuck not knowing how it ended.

Currently, *Prodigy* isn't on any of the streaming services, including the aforementioned Paramount+ (the service all the other *Star Trek* series are on mind you). I can buy the first 10 episodes on DVD or Blu Ray, but not the last 10. I could buy the entire series digitally on Amazon, but I don't trust Amazon to not pull the rug out from under me and remove access to my purchases. So for now, my options are to buy the first 10 episodes on a disc and hope that 11-20 comes out later, or wait and hope I can get the entire series on disc.

I'm pretty much out of luck right now.

*Star Trek: Prodigy* was a fun show. It was targeted for kids, but still enjoyable as a *Star Trek* fan. I was bummed to hear it was cancelled after only a single season. I was pissed though, that it was pulled from the service.

You know why people pirate media? This is why.

It's also why I've been much more focused lately about buying the physical media for music, TV, & movies. They can pull the media off of streaming services, but I'll still be able to stick the DVD or Blu Ray into my player.

CBS Studios will be shopping *Star Trek: Prodigy* to other studios so hopefully someone will pick it up soon.
