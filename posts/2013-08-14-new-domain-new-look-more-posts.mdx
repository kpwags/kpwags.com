excerpt: "Over the last couple months, I've been seriously considering doing a rebranding. I felt that DarkNemesis and Darker Nemesis just didn't really feel like 'me' anymore. So I went about trying to find a new moniker. 'Wags' has always been sort of a nickname for me given my last name being Wagner and 'kpwags' was available so after some thought, I ended up liking it and now here we are."

Over the last couple months, I've been seriously considering doing a rebranding. I felt that DarkNemesis and Darker Nemesis just didn't really feel like 'me' anymore. So I went about trying to find a new moniker. "Wags" has always been sort of a nickname for me given my last name being Wagner and "kpwags" was available so after some thought, I ended up liking it and now here we are.

The main reason I wanted to re-make my blog is that I've been wanting to write a lot more and figure this gives me a venue to write about this and that without having to focus so much on an overarching story like in the novel I'm writing.

So welcome!
