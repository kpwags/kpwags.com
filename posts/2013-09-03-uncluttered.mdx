One of the biggest things I try to do is keep my desk uncluttered. I find that it helps me stay organized. As an example, here's my desk at work.

You can see that there's not much on my desk. I have a few decorative items around my desk, but not much with regards to loose papers and other clutter. What is normally out for me is my iPad and my Moleskin notebook.

So what about you? What do you keep on your desk? How do you stay organized?
