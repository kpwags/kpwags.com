I can't believe the first half of 2022 is already over. Another month has come and gone and I'm not sure what I have to show for it.

## Recovering from COVID

At the end of May, I ended up getting COVID as I mentioned. Thanks to the vaccine and booster, it wasn't too bad, but I've struggled to get back into the swing of fitness. I was in a nice groove, but now I feel a little "off". Not physically, just mentally. Between work & hockey, I feel like I haven't had the time to get my normal lifting sessions in. I didn't run as much as I would've hoped as I'm still getting my lung capacity back. I'm not rushing into anything as I start training for the marathon next month. Figure ease myself back into it.

The other downside of COVID throwing me for a loop is that I'm also figuring this will probably be my best chance to hit my deadlift goal and my goal of hitting the 1,000 lbs. club. I'm hoping to go for 365 on squats and 400 on deadlifts. That, combined with my 235 on bench press will give me 1,000 lbs. on the nose. Maybe I'll be able to try to work up bench press to 250 like I wanted in December, but I'm not holding my breath. I already hit my squats goal of 350, so if I can hit 400 on deadlifts, and 1,000 between bench press, squats & deadlifts this year, I'll be quite happy.

## The Re-Design

At the beginning of the month, I released a redesign of the blog. I ended up changing the color and slightly tweaked the layouts. I decided I wanted the home page to have a little more pop. I like the way it turned out. I ended up cleaning up some of the code I used to display what [I'm currently up to](https://kpwags.com/current), the [bookshelf](https://kpwags.com/bookshelf) and [movies](https://kpwags.com/movies) pages as well. Still got a little bit to clean up here and there, but I like it so far.

I'm hoping to introduce a few tweaks to make posting a little smoother and easier over the next month.

## New York City

I ended up going to New York City mid-month for my birthday. The weather was nice and it wasn't too hot. Not too much to report, though I was able to go to the Morgan Library and Museum and that was incredible. So many old and classic books, including two Gutenberg Bibles on display.

## Brand New Desktop

After going back and forth for the last few months, I finally ended up deciding to build a brand new PC. I kept my graphics card from my old one as well as the SSD, but got a new CPU, RAM & case. I ended up going with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and bumped my RAM up to 32 GB. Took the plunge and went with Windows 11 as well. No complaints so far. Figure I should be good with PC gaming for a while. I can upgrade the graphics card later down the line.
