I think I'm going to start this series of entries again. Trying to continue to share the interesting articles and stories I've read over the course of the week.

[**We All Knew This Would Happen**](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/we-all-knew-this-would-happen/) - This is basically why I've stayed away from crypto. I feel like it's more speculative than anything else. I have a small brokerage fund where I invest in individual stocks, but 99% of my investments are in various different index funds. <span className="domain-name">(ofdollarsanddata.com)</span>

[**Why I don't miss React: a story about using the platform**](https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/working-with-react-and-the-web-platform/) - I've been working heavily in React both at work and home. It's an interesting thought about the possibility of moving away from React and more to native browser APIs. <span className="domain-name">(jackfranklin.co.uk)</span>

[**You Don't Need A UI Framework**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework) - Josh Comeau writes about some of the pitfalls of full UI frameworks such as Material UI. While I agree with him in many aspects, I think there's more to it and I believe they have their place. A framework can make it easier to handle re-inventing some the wheels with controls, or trying to unify the look and feel of a bunch of different 3rd party control libraries. While I like to build my own stuff sometimes to learn how to things work, there is something to be said for letting a polished library handle it. You still have to learn how to put it all together. <span className="domain-name">(smashingmagazine.com)</span>

[**Why Blog?**](https://cagrimmett.com/thoughts/2022/04/26/why-blog/) - I'm not sure how many people read this, but Chuck nails a lot of the reasons why I still have my blog and try to continue writing. <span className="domain-name">(cagrimmett.com)</span>
