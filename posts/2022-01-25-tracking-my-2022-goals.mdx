Goals can be a funny thing. We all set them, and what happens next can be all over the spectrum. I figured I’d build a little something to help keep me accountable.

You can view this [new page](https://kpwags.com/progress/2022) where you can see the goals I’ve set and the progress I’m currently at. The lifting goals are a little weird as it looks like I’m already almost there. I can say with absolute certainty though that getting that little bit more will be harder than it may seem.
