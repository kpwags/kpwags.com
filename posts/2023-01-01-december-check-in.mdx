December was a quiet month, but I feel like I spent the better part of it dealing with colds.

## Cold Season is Back

After generally avoiding being sick over the last 2 years, I ended up with back to back colds. The first and last week of the month I was knocked on my ass with a cough and a nose running more than a faucet. Tested negative for COVID thankfully, so just annoying bugs I had to deal with...twice.

## Christmas with Family

Thankfully the colds sort of surrounded Christmas and didn’t occur on the actual holiday. Lauren and I were able to spend time with both of our families over the holidays. I even saw my one brother who I haven’t seen since before the pandemic. I also met his son for the first time, my nephew who was born during the pandemic.

Other than that, it was a relatively quiet month.
