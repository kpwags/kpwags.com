    I was late to the TypeScript train, but now that I've been using it both at work and on my side projects, I miss it when I don't have it.

    <blockquote className="small">TypeScript had to be free and open source, and done in a truly out-in-the-open manner. It also had to interoperate seamlessly with existing JavaScript, co-evolve with JavaScript, and *feel* like JavaScript.</blockquote>

    Given my experience working with TypeScript, I'd say they've done a good job allowing developers to integrate TypeScript into the development process with minimal impact.

    This podcast has been doing a great job talking about the struggles Miami is having to deal with given the changing climate. I'd highly recommend a listen as climate change is a real threat and is something that will extend well beyond just Miami.
