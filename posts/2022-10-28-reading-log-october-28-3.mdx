Too much Musk this week.

    Twitter is now in Elon Musk's hands and I suspect he's in well over his head. I myself am probably leaving Twitter and am already more active on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@kpwags). Free speech is what makes this country great but time and time again this has proven to turn online platforms into cesspools. Assuming Musk treats Twitter the same way as Gab, Parler and the like, I would imagine that Twitter would probably head down that route too, though probably to a lesser extent.

    My blog runs on Next.js and I'm curious as to the new improvements, especially with regards to [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#introducing-turbopack-alpha)
