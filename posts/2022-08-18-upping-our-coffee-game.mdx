A couple months ago, my wife and I decided to up our coffee game.

We ended up getting a nice [OXO Coffee Grinder](https://www.oxo.com/conical-burr-coffee-grinder.html) with the hopes of trying different coffee beans. We started small getting some local beans, but then I got it into my head to look into a coffee subscription service. We ended up going with [Trade](https://www.drinktrade.com/) and for the last several months have been getting a new bag delivered to us every other week from various roasters from across the country.

I'd like to say it stopped there, but then we decided it would be a good time to get an espresso machine. We ended up getting the [Breville Bambino Plus](https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/espresso/bes500.html). I can't say I have any regrets with that decision. Being able to make a latte at home is convenient. It takes a little more work than simply pressing the brew button on my coffee maker, but they're delicious. Lauren even was able to make a vanilla simple syrup to up the latte game. I'm hoping to be able to get using the machine down to a science enough that I can quickly and easily add some espresso shots to my coffee when I need that extra oomph in the morning.

Over the last several months, we've gotten some coffee beans we've really liked and it's nice to be able to try some coffee from shops we otherwise wouldn't be able try. If you like coffee and want to give a coffee service a try, I'd highly recommend it. We've been happy with [Trade](https://www.drinktrade.com/), but there are plenty of others out there.

Also, thanks to the [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/) for helping figure out what gear was best for us.
