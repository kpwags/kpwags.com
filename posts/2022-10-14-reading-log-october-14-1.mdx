It's been a little bit since I've posted one of these. Been busy working on other projects and playing Wrath of the Lich King. Anyway, here's the newest list.

    I found this in one of the newsletters I subscribe to. I'm going to give it a try as I appreciate some of the ideas.

    - **Gratitude**: It's important to remember all the people & things you're thankful for. All too ofthen it's easy to forget in the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
    - **Stress & Suck**: No one likes stress, but I think writing down some of the things that stress you out could help alleviate some of them.
    - **Goals**: Keeping track of goals, even long-term can help keep myself accountable.
