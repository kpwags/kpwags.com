It seems like a new year just started and already we're one month in...

## Getting Back into Fitness
Not that I really stopped last year, but I started a bigger emphasis on it this year. I've made a concerted effort to drink less alcohol and try to limit my snacking. So far it's been working. I didn't do *Dry January* but I did a better job of not overindulging on the weekends.

With the nice weather, I've also been getting more runs in. I managed 48 miles in January, somehow running in the high 40s and low 50s some days.

With regards to lifting, I switched back to running an *nSuns* based routine. I'm putting in more sets and reps and have been getting back to my personal bests. I'm 100 pounds away from my goal of joining the 1,000 pound club!

## Picking Up Blazor
As a .NET developer, Blazor has been on my radar for a little while now. I decided to play around with it and learn by building a web app to go through and organize my baseball card collection (because why not?). I haven't gotten that far and I'm actually toying with the idea of streaming a little bit of it on Twitch or something.

## Go Birds

The Philadelphia Eagles are back in the Super Bowl facing off against the Kansas City Chiefs. Grease those light posts!
