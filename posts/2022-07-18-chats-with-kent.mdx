I've been finally catching up on my (all-too-massive) podcast backlog and figured I'd place a shout-out to the podcast Chats with Kent.

For fellow devs out there, I'd recommend subscribing to and listening to it. I'm currently on the 4th season and he has some great chats with various developers with a wide variety of backgrounds.
