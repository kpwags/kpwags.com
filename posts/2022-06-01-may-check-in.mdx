May was an eventful month. I didn't do much because I was exposed to COVID…and then got COVID later in the month. Needless to say, the month could have gone better, but it could have been far worse.

## COVID

Getting the COVID part over with…early in the month, my wife and I ended up getting exposed to COVID. We opted to play it safe and isolated ourselves up in the house for 3-4 days to make sure we didn't have it or spread it to others. We never got it…then later in the month happened. I got it, presumably from hockey, and while I holed myself up in the basement trying to protect my wife from it, failed at that too. While certainly not pleasant, both of us are fine now and thankfully only had to deal with mild symptoms. Being vaccinated and boosted certainly helped keep us out of the hospital and alive.

## Data & Office Clean-Up

Earlier in the month I decided to delve back into Linux by putting the latest version of Fedora on my desktop to dual boot. I was hoping to extend its life a little bit, but even with Fedora, it is seemingly a little on the sluggish side. I'll have to play around with it a little bit to see if I can figure out what's going on. It was beneficial though because it allowed me to pull the data off my old server's hard drives. I used to run a file server on an old desktop computer. Sadly it died and all my data was just sitting around on the hard drives. I recently bought a Synology NAS and spent the better part of a weekend pulling data off the old drives and put them onto my NAS. I have to do some organization, but at least the data is now accessible.

## Fitness News

I also finally made the decision to run the 2022 Philadelphia Marathon. I've been going back and forth on it, and finally decided to run it in an attempt to run a sub-5 hour marathon. I'll have to trim 15 minutes from my 2015 time, but I think it's doable. Official training starts in August, but I'm gonna try to slowly up the distance prior.

I also ended up hitting new PRs on both deadlifts and squats. Managed 385 lbs. on deadlifts, and hit my 350 lbs. goal on squats. Yay me! I ended up stalling on bench press so hopefully I can get that going again in June. Want to try to hit my goals by the time marathon training kicks in.

## Stage Fright

I volunteered to give a presentation on unit testing to my company's development department. I was nervous as all get-out, but managed to do it. Probably could've done a little better, but it didn't go bad.
