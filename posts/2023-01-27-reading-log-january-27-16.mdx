A lot of CSS related posts this week. Also, Astro v2.0 was released this week. I've been toying with building something in it, and it looks like it's added a bunch of good stuff. And one of my favorite games as a kid has been re-launched on the Xbox and the Switch!

    I gave a talk to my company about unit testing last year and one thing that stood out to me was the idea that 100% coverage doesn't always mean ‚Äúgood code‚Äù, but low coverage is a sign of potential issues. Antoine echoes that sentiment and is right here pointing out that just because you have 100% coverage, doesn't mean that the tests are useful.
