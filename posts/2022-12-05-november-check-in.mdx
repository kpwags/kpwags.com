Thanksgiving has come and gone, so that means November has also come and gone. It was not a bad month by any means as I got to spend time with my family for both my niece's baptism as well as Thanksgiving.

## Hockey Injuries are No Fun
In mid-November, I ended up getting run into while playing goalie in the upper leagues at the ice rink I play at. Banged up my groin and hip pretty badly which kept me off the ice and away from legs days at the gym for 2 weeks. It could've obviously been way worse, so thankfully it wasn't a long-term thing. Just frustrating because the players are better and should have better control over their skating. I expect this more in the lower leagues where players are still learning how to skate.

## Thanksgiving
I ended up spending Thanksgiving at my Aunt's house. It was nice to see most of my Dad's side of the family. Caught up since it had been a while since I've seen any of them. Turned out to be a nice day too after a seemingly early cold spell.

## Fitness Tracker
I had put this project aside to work on Digital Family Cookbook. I decided to re-start this project from the ground up as I realized the original foundation, while definitely useable, could've been better constructed. Like most of my side projects, I learn more and want to build on what I've learned to build better systems. I have a few more tasks on Digital Family Cookbook, but I should be able to knock them out pretty easily when I'm in the mood. The restart of Fitness Tracker is also giving me the chance to start from scratch with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). I'll probably write up some quick thoughts on them sometime in December.
