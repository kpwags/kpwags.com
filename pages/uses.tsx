                <h2>Computers</h2>

                <h3>PC</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a custom build desktop that I use for development and gaming. It&apos;s not the most up to date, but it still runs
                    every game I&apos;ve thrown at it. It runs an older Core i7, 16GB RAM & a GTX 1060 graphics card.
                </p>

                <h3>Laptop</h3>
                <p>
                    I have an 13&quot; M1 MacBook Pro and while I&apos;ve only had it for a short period of time, I love it.
                </p>

                <h2>Peripherals</h2>

                <h3>Montitors</h3>
                <p>
                    I have two desks. On my desk for gaming and personal development, I use dual

                    .
                    For work, I use a

                    {' '}
                    which
                    I love as well.
                </p>

                <h3>Keyboard</h3>
                <p>
                    I picked up the

                    with the aluminum frame and Gateron Red switches. I love its Bluetooth connectivity between my MacBook and my PC as well as its compact frame and number keypad.
                </p>

                <h3>Mouse</h3>
                <p>
                    I have the

                    . Has the added bonus of being able to connect to 3 computers.
                </p>

                <h2>Mobile Devices</h2>
                <p>
                    I&apos;m currently using an iPhone 12 Pro with an Apple Watch Series 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My tablet is a the 6th generation iPad. I wanted a tablet to read the news and whatnot, and this does the trick.
                    The Apple Pencil support is an added bonus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the iPad does a good job for reading the news, I love my Kindle Paper White for reading books and long
                    pieces. The screen is easy on the eyes, good in the sun, and in darker rooms.
                </p>

                <h2>Headphones</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">Apple AirPods Pro</a>:
                    </strong>
                    &nbsp;It took a little bit of persuading and a sale, but I picked a pair of these up and the integration into the iPhone
                    and iPad ecosystem is pretty awesome. The battery and sound quality is top notch.
                </p>
                <p>

                    </strong>
                    &nbsp;Originally, I couldn&apos;t justify the price for Apple&apos;s AirPods Pro, so I went with these and have not been disappointed. Good sound
                    quality and the pure wireless factor is nice.
                </p>
                <p>

                    </strong>
                    &nbsp;I got these for their noise cancelling and Bluetooth connectivity. The sound quality is good and the battery
                    life makes them perfect for full days in the office working.
                </p>

                    </strong>
                    I got these a long while ago and still use them while working at my desk quite a bit.
                </p>

                <h2>Cameras</h2>
                <p>
                    My main camera is a Canon 60D. For a prosumer camera model, it takes great shots. I love taking it out and
                    capturing the world. I have the following lenses for it:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tamron Lens</li>
                    <li>Canon Telephoto</li>
                    <li>Canon Wide Angle</li>
                    <li>Canon Kit Lens</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I also have a Canon G1X for when I don&apos;t want to lug around my big DSLR. It&apos;s not quite compact enough that I
                    can stick it in my pocket, but it&apos;s still a little easier to pack and carry around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have 2 GoPro Hero 3&apos;s that I occasionally use to record my hockey games when I&apos;m in net. It helps me see where
                    I need to improve.
                </p>
